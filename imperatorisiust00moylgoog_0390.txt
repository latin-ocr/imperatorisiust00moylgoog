iudicia ordinaria see Excursus X at the end oi this volume, and Mr.
Poste's note on Gaius iii. 77. He adopts Savigny's theory that there
were, from the first, two different modes os proceeding against insolvent
debtors: the one-manus iniectio or personal execution-applying only
where the judgment or confession on which execution issued was on a
money loan, real (mutuum) or fictitious (nexum) or on certain other
obligations assimilated by statute to mutuum, Gaius iv. ης the other, or
execution against the property, being resorted to in all other cases. Α
commoner view is that, until about roo lac, manus iniectio (though its
severities were mitigated by the lex Poetelia, Livy viii. 28) was the only
remedy open to a creditor ir his debtor refused or was unable to satisfy
a judgment debt ; about which time a new form os execution against the
property, or real execution, was introduced by the Edict, ol which a
leading feature was sale of the bankrupt's universitas iuris by auction to
the bidder who offered the creditors the highest percentage on their
claims, this praetorian form os bankruptcy execution being called bonorum
emptio or venditio, and being described by Gaius (iii. 77-81) as one os
the kinds oi universal succession.

Though it is difficolt to come to any definite conclusion on so obscure
a topic, the latter view seems best supported by the facts, apart from its
inherent probability on grounds os historical jurisprudence. Savigny has
to prove two positions: first, that personal execution was confined to
the classes os debts specified3 and second, that a system ol real execu-
tion was in vogue at Rome srom the earliest times.

ln support os the former he calls attention to what seems an un·
deniable lact, viz. that the Romans always drew a broad distinction
between debts incurred by money loans and all other debts, and cites
various authors (e. g. Gellius 20. 1, quoting the Twelve Tables, and Livy vi.
14, viii. 28, xxiii. ¹4) to show that manus iniectio is almost invariably
associated with debts of the first kind On the other hand, we have the
explicit statement os Gaius (iv. 21) that it was the proper procedure on
every judgment debt, however incurred. Savigny, however, relies most
on chaps. 21 and 22 of the lex Rubria or lex Galliae Cisalpinae, in which
it is provided that when an action is brought ior pecunia certa credita,
manus iniectio shall be employed: when on any other liability, another
procedure may be resorted to—‘ eos duci, bona eorum possideri iubeto.’
On his interpretation, this means that, for pecunia certa credita, the
execution must be personal, while in other cases it must be real ; but it
is sermore natural to suppose that, except lor money loans, the statute
