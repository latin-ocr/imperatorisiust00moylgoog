EXCURSUS Vl.

DOLUS, CULPA, AND CASUS.

A 211111 to a contract or quasi-contract may commit a breach of
its terme, express or implied‚ either intentionally or unintentionally.
Deliberate breach (dolus) always entailed liability-dolus semper
praestatur—which could not be evaded even by an explicit agreement
to the contrary: ‘Celsus putat non valere, si convenerit, ne dolus
praestetur: hoc enim bonae fidei iudicio contrarium est: et ita utimur'
Dig. 50. 17. 231 ci. Dig. 2. 14. 27. 3. Certain unintentional breaches
were treated in the same manner, whether consisting in acts of com·
mission or of omission: viz. those which arose from want of ordinary
care, from a carelessness so excessive that no ordinary man would
have been guilty ο1 it: this is called culpa lata, and lor it, even' in
contractual and quasi-contractual relations, one is always answerable
no less than sor dolus, or deliberate and intentional breach: ‘lata
culpa est nimia negligentia, id est, non intellegere quod omnes intelle·
gunt’ Dig. 50. 16. ²13· a: ib. 223. pr, ‘lata culpa plane dolo com-
parabitur' Dig. 11. 6. 1. 1, ‘prope dolum est' Dig. 17. 1. ²9· pr.,
‘dolum repraesentat' Dig. 47. 4. 1. 2, ‘dolus est’ Dig. 50. 16. 226:
16. 3. 31.

But 112 man’s negligence or culpa is not os this extreme degree,
the question whether he is answerable 1ο1 11 is determined by reference
to two standards or criteria ol caresulncss‚ the one abstract or abso-
lute, the other relative or concrete.

· (r) In some relations amanis required to show what the Romans Ι
call exacta diligentia, or the diligentia ο1 a bonus paterfamilias, a care-
121, accurate, sound man ol business ;·here he is answerable sor 211
culpa, provided it could have been avoided by one more careful than
himself : ‘culpa autem abest si omnia facta sunt quae diligentissimus
quisquc observaturus luisset' Dig. 19. 2. 257. Modern writers call
this culpa levis in abstracto: in the authorities it is usually called
culpa simply: when it is said that a manis answerable not only for
dolus but for culpa as well, what is meant is that he is answerable sor
levis culpa: the liabih'ty sor lata culpa, being universal, is implied.
