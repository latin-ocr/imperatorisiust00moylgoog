78 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK I.

division into persons, things, and actions, and to ascertain its relation
to other arrangements oi private law, such as those oi Savigny (General
Introduction, p. ⁶⁷ sq, supr.) or ol Austin and his school.

Our only business here is to ascertain what Gaius and Justinian
intended by ‘ius quod ad personas pertinet! It seems clear that the
only method by which this can be done is the analytical. Austin, it is
to be regretted, setin England the example of pursuing a ‘high
a priori road’ in connection with this matter; the principal form ol
which is to adopt, as the leading division oi law, that into ‘the law oi
persons' and ‘the law of things,' though in a sense differing consider· ι
ably from that in which it was understood by the Roman lawyers, and
then either to find lault with the latter for not having meant the same
as the writer, or to imply that they really meant the same thing,
though owing to the wealmess of their legal philosophy they did not
adhere with any consistency to their own principle, and thereby com·
mitted most egregious saults ol classification. Even il this be true, it
is probably a worse fault still to take a classica] expression (such as
‘law oi persons' which to its authors, we may surely believe, meant
something perfeetly precise), give it a new signification without
lrankly consessing that a liberty has been taken ; and then to irresist-
ibly suggest that the two meanings are the same, ii the authors oi the
expression really meant anything by it at all. To an English reader
the greatest difficulty, in the effort to understand the arrangement of
Gaius andJustinian, arises irorn Austin’s perversiori ol the expressions
‘law oi persons' and ‘law os things',sor the purposes os his own
system. lf he had meant something totally different from them there
would have been no confusion ; but the very fact that his meaning
was somewhat the same, but at the same time somewhat different,
has surrounded the matter with difficulties, to remove which au
attempt will be made by pursuing a strictly analytical method, and by
attending strictly to the language ol the Roman lawyers themselves,
without giving any lancy meaning to classical expressions whose actual
signification can be ascertained with tolerable certainty.

What did the Romans mean by ‘persona 'l It is clear there is some
relation between persona and homo; for the leading division oi the ‘ius
quod ad personas pertinet' (i. 3. pr.) is that all men are either lree or
slaves. It is equally clear that they did not regard all men as personet
it is not said all persons, but all men, are either free or slaves. Slaves,
in fact, except very occasionally by a slip oi the pen (e. g. Inst i. 8. pr.)
are not regarded by the Romans as persons ς an essential clement in

the idea ol persona is the capacity oi acquiring and possessing legal
