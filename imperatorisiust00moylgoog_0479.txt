The legal effects of natural obligation have as yet been defined
only negatively; it did not entitle the creditor to sue. As to its
positive effects‚ no general rule can be laid down for all cases: they
must be determined ior each case individually‚ lor the creditors right,
in one instance, may have a greater or less orbit than in another;
in other words, apart from the right os action, anatural obligatior
may possibly entitle him to all or any of the rights which he would
have were the debitor bound civiliter, or possess all or any of the iol·

(1)It excludes condictio indebiti (note on Bk. iii. 14. 1), ie. ii
money is owed naturaliter only, and is paid, even by mistalre, it
cannot be recovered on the ground that itis not due: ‘naturales obli·
gationes non eo solo aestimantur, si actio aliqua earum nomine
competit, verum etiam cum soluta pecunia repeti non potest' Dig.
46. 1. 16. 4. ,

(2) lt can bo set off against an actionable claim oi the debtor on
the creditor, e. g. it Α owes B 1ol. naturaliter, and B owes A sot
civiliter, B on being sued by A can set the rol. off against the eol,
though he cannot directly sue for it himself : ‘etiam quod natura debe-
tur venit in compensationem’ Dig. ib. 26; ci. Blr. iv. 6 39 ini.

(3) It forms a sufficient basis sor those other rights which ean only

on Bk. iii. ao. 9), and novation (Bk. iii. 29. 3, Dig. 39. 5. 19. 4); by
constitutum a natural can be converted into acivil obligation by a
mere formless second promise by the dcbt'or, Dig. 13. 5. 1. 7.
