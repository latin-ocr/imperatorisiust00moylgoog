etiam constitutionem in nostro posuimus codice, qua pros-
pectum est, ut, si mente captos habeant filios vel nepotes vel
pronepotes cuiuscumque sexus vel gradus, liceat eis, etsi pu-
beres sint, ad exemplum pupillaris substitutionis certas per-
sonas substituere: sin autem resipuerint, eandem substitu-
tionem infirmari, et hoc ad exemplum pupillaris substitutionis,

institution of customary law. Where a paterfamilias instituted as his
heir his impubes filiusfamilias (or one not yet born, postumus, ξ 4
inf, Dig. 28. 6. a. pn), he could substitute to the latter so as to meet
not only the event of his predecessing him himself, and so not becoming
heir at all, but also that of his becoming heir, and then dying before he
reached puberty: and even if he disinherited the child, he could appoint
a substitutus to him in the event of his dying impubes, to take any
property which he might himself acquire between his becuming sui iuris
and his death. The object of the practice in either case was clearly to
save the child from dying intestate: not being able, ex hypothesi, to
make a valid will for himself, his paterfamilias was allowed to make one
for him, ξ 2, which became void eo instanti that he himself acquired
testamentary capacity, ξ 8. The differences between this and vulgar
substitution are clear at a glance. The latter operates only if the in-
stitutus falls to take the inheritance: if he once accepts, the contingent
right of the substitutus falls to the ground. But pupillary substitution is
not necessarily made to an institutus at all: it may be made to a dis·
inherited child ; and even if the child as a fact is instituted, and actually
takes the inheritance, the substitution may still operate, and will, ifthe ,
heres dies under the age of puberty.

lf the pupillariter substitutus was himself instituted, jointly with the
child, to the inheritance and refused it, he could not take under the
substitution: conversely, his acceptance of it was an implicit acceptance
of the child’s inheritance in case he became entitled‚ Dig. 28. 6. ro. 3,
Cod. 6. 30. ao.

A pupillary substitution became void not only on the child’s attaining
puberty, but also by his dying or otherwise passing out of potestas
during the father’s lifetime, and by his falling on the pater’s death under
the potestas of another, though not by his subsequent adrogation, Dig.
1.7. 17. r.

§ L This quasi pupillaris or exemplaris substitutio, as it is commonly
called, was, as a general right, a new creation of Justinian, and was quite
independent of patria potestas, being allowed to ascendants of either
sex, Cod. 6. 26. 9: but in their choice of a successor to the mente captus
they were limited, in the first instance, to descendants of the latter, in
the second, to descendants of their own; in default of both they might
select whom they pleased: this is the meaning of ‘certas personas’ in
the text. In general the rules of substitutio pupillaris applied. By
