even with the heir's own property, suffice to pay the letters debts als03
in such a case as this they were entitled to apply within five years to
the praetor sora separatio bonorum, the effect oi which was to prefer
their own rights against the bona separata to those ol the heir's own
creditors, though they lorieited all claim to any subsequent payment
from the heir's own property, should the separated portion prove in lact
insufficient for their satisfaction, Dig. 42. 6. r. 1. Τὴε heir, however, is
bound by his testator's dispositions. He may in his will have done more
than institute an heir; he may have given legacies or fideicommissa,
leit instructions as to his funeral, appointed guardiam to his children
and settled the arrangements lor their education, forbidden alienation ol
certain res hereditariae, and so lortb. All these dispositions are valid
and binding on the heir, Dig. 33. 1. 7. r 3 44. 7. 5. 2.

When there are two or more joint heirs, the hereditas passes to them
collectively, as awhole3 there is said to bea communio in it between
thern, but to each of thern individually it passes only pro rata; each
coheres is not liable for the testator’s debts in full, but only in the same
ratio in which be is instituted, the liabilities being divided between thern
ipso iure, Cod 3. 36. 3. Division oi course would usually take place by
arrangement, but il any one reiused to concur, he could be compelled
by the actio familiae erciscundae, to which also he could'resort is be
thought be was being unfairly treated by his coheirs, ‘haec actio pro·
ficiscitur ex lege duodecim tabularum, namque coheredibus, volentibus a
communione discedere, necessarium videbatur aliquam actionem con·
stitui, qua inter eos res hereditariae distribuerentur’ Dig. ro. 2. r. pr.
Sometimes a coheres could not claim a division without bringing into
the inheritance certain property olbis own (collatio bonorum). This
practice had originated in the praetorian bonorum possessio, whether
contra tabulas or ab intestato; the praetor would not admit emancipati
to share the estate with their unemancipated brothers and sisters unless
they brought into ‘botchpot' all that they had acquired sor themselves
since their own release {rom potestas, Dig. 37. 6. 1, 14 The Emperors,
especially A. Pius and Leo, further developed the obligation, requiring
that where a number of descendants succeeded jointly toa common
ascendant, each female should bring in the dos which she had received
from the latter (dotis collatio), and the rule was subsequently extended to
much other property which descendants ol either sex bad received {rom
the common ascendant in his liletime, Dig. 37. 6.
