146Δ INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. l.

enascuntur patris,¹ non matris familiam sequuntur. Quod
autern lex ab intestato vocat ad tutelam adgnatos, non hanc
habet significationem, si omnino non fecerit testamentum is
qui poterat tutores dare, sed si quantum ad tutelam pertinet
intestatus decesserit. quod tunc quoque accidere intellegitur,

3cum is qui datus est tutor vivo testatore decesserit. Sed
adgnationis quidem ius omnibus modis capitis deminutione
plerumque perimitur: nam adgnatio iuris est nomen. cogna-
tionis vero ius non omnibus modis commutatur, quia civilis
¹ratio civilia quidem iura corrumpere potest, naturalia vero non
utique.

Est autem capitis deminutio prioris status commutatio.
eaque tribus modis accidit: nam aut maxima est capitis
deminutio aut minor, quam quidam mediam vocant, aut

exclude cognates who, even though per virilis sexus personas coniuncti,
had by capitis deminutio leit their (agnatio) family. 'lbis last error oi
· Gaius' and Justinian’s definition is avoided by Ulpian, reg. 11.4‚ who
adds ‘eiusdem familiae! Agnates,· in fact, are persons related to one
another through males, whether the relationship be natural, adoptive,
or quasi-adoptive as produced by manus, and between whom no barrier
has been interposed by capitis deminuti03 and agnation is the tie be·
tween two or more persons which is based on the potestas or manus to
which all of them would be subject if the head oi the familia were still
alive: see Maine, Ancient Law pp. 146-8. For the reason why the de·
scendants oia woman were not agnates oi her blood relations see ou
Tit. 9. 3 supr.

which and the tutela legitima there was such an intimate connection)

were not accompanied by corresponding changes in the law os guardian· ’

ship. By Nov. 118 Justinian revolutionized the former branch of law by
substituting title by cognatiori for title by agnation, and modified the
law of guardianship in accordance therewith‚ cognatio relationship alone
in future conferring a claim to tutela legitima.

§a This passage is borne out by Bk.iii.1.11ins. ‘naturalia enim
iura civilis ratio perimere non potest‚' but (as is observed by Mr. Poste
on Gaiusi.158) is almost completely contradicted by Tit. 16. sint,
which expressly (and truly) says that the two higher kinds of capitis
deminutio destroyed naturalia iura based on cognatio no less than civilia
iura based on adgnatio.
