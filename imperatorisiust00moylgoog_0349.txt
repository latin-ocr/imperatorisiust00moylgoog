334 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK JII.

,Roman Law3 alternatives are soon tolerated ior the old sacramental
terms, which none could use but Roman citizens, and thus peregrini
are enabled to avail themselves of this universally applicabis contract
¹iorrn ; the question and answer are allowed to be expressed in other
languages than Latinand the strict and literal correspondence between
them is no longer regarded as indispensable; finally, that they should
be oral, and so require the presence ¹os the parties, is found to be an
inconvenient and unnecessary condition, and the original solemnities
oi stipulation have dwindled into a written memorandum of a promise
fictitiously represented as having been made inanswer to a preceding
question. Some minor matters, such as the qualification ol such
,promises by time and conditione, and the use oi penalties under·
many circumstances, are touched upon in the same Title. Joint and
several liability, or as the modern civilians term it, Correality or
Solidarity, is briefly noticed in Title 16, because whenever it arose ex
'contractu it usually took the form of stipulation. In Title 17 we bave

oi circumstances which aiiect the velidity os contracta in general, and

and weakness os intellecty and here too we have a precise statement
of the jural maxim that an obligation is a tie between ascertained
parties, incapable oi conferring rights or imposing liabilities on others
who are not parties to it themselves, and Justinian's own repeal oi
some previously existing rules invalidating stipulatione, but out of
harmony with the modern principle that ‘consent is the essence of
contract’ Title ao relates to fideiussio, a form of suretyship effected
by stipulation ; other modes in which this important relation could be
established are described in the notes to this Title and Title ad. Title
