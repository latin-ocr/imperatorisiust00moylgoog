hac causa acciderit ei, contra quem plus petitum suerit, com·
missa tripli condemnatione, sicut supra diximus, puniatur.

Whether in integrum restitutio propter dolum and metum was older
than these remedies, and was to a great extent superseded by them,
as Savigny contends, is uncertain ; at any rate it seems clear from Cic.
de off. 3. 14 that restitutio doli causa was unknown before the time oi
Gallus Aquilius. lt is, however, certain that their concurrent existence
narrowed the operation of the equitable relies on these two causae.

An instance oi restitutio propter errorem is supplied in the text above ;
the other cases ot its application suggest the conclusion that it was
almost entirely contined to laesiones incurred in the progress oi an
action, though examples os its occurrence in substantive law are found in
Dig.42.6.1.17;34.9.17.

Restitutio propter capitis deminutionem occurred only where the
capitis deminutio was minima: ‘pertinet hoc edictum ad eas capitis
deminutiones, quae salva civitate contingunt; ceterum sive amissione
civitatis, sive libertatis amissione contingat capitis deminutio, cessabit
edictum' Dig. 4 5. 2. pr. For its application see Bk. iii. to 3 and notes
supr.

Persons who, while absent either rei publicae causa, or by reason oi
justifiable tear, or in captivity with a public enemy, lost rights of
property or os action could obtain restitution; and persons at home
could get themselves restituti against others who had obtained a pro·
prietary advantage (e. g. by usucapio, § 5 supr.) or release from an action
while abroad or imprisoned.

'lhe edict upon this subject tenninated with the so·called generalis
clausula: ‘item si qua alia causa videbitur, in integrum restituam’ Dig.
4. 6. 11 ; ib. 26. 9 ; words apparently intended to include all cases, other
than those already specified‚ in which the realization oi a right was
prevented by obstacles oi lact rather than ol law.

(3) As a general rule, the case must be one in which the ordinary law
affords no relies : ‘in causae cognitione etiam hoc versabitur, num forte
alia actio possit competere citra in integrum restitutio ; nam si communi
auxilio et mero iure munitus sit, non debet ei tribui extraordinarium
auxilium’ Dig. 4. 4 16. pr. But occasionally restitutio was merely an
alternative, e. g. to the actio doli, quod metus causa, tutelae (Dig. 4. 447.
1), and the bonae fidei actions, Cod. 2. 54. 3; 4. 44. 5; ib.10. Tbere
are also a number ot other exceptions to its general application ; e. g. no
one could claim restitutio against penal lawa, against a patron or ascend·
ant, or against his own dolus.

(4) Restitutio must be applied lor within a period os prescription fixed
originally at an annus utilis, and extended by Justinian to a quadriennium
continuum (note on ξ 5 supa). lt is disputed from what moment prescrip·
tion began to run; according to some this is (except in absentia and
minor aetas) the date os laesio ; according to others, the tennination oi
the causa.
