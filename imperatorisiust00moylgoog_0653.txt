638 EXCURSUS X.

the head of the formula, alter the appointment of the iudex,wheno'e
their name praescriptiones. This was frequently the cose when the
defendant's contentiori was that the action ought not to be tried at
all because it would prejudge a ‘causa maior' (praescriptio prae·
iudicii); and the purpose ol thus placing the objection in the lore-
ground was to indicate to the iudex that he was first to examine into
its tmth or lalsehood, and il he found it well-grounded‚ to suspend
the hearing until it was removed by the decision ol the larger suit.
Other objections ol the same character were that the action was
beyond the competence ol the court (praescriptio lori), or was barred
by lapse ol time (praescriptio temporis) ; and the actual form they
took was the same as that ol praescriptiones pro actore (p. 628 supa),
viz. ea res agatur, etc: see Gaius iv. ¹33· The practice ol lor-
mulating such objections merely as exceptiones had commenced as
early as Cicero (de invent. ii. ao), and Gaius tells us (iv. 133) that in
his time praescriptiones ol this kind were entirely obsolete: in speciem
exceptionis deducuntur. The change was material; lor now, if the
delence was established, the defendant was entitled to acquittal;

whereas before, when it took the lorm of a praescriptio, the hearing ἶ

was only suspended, and he might be condemned alter all.

The proceedings in iure may now be imagined at an end. Their
object was to lormally define the issues to be tried in the action; to
give a legal form to a dispute which bad hitherto existed only as a
matter of lact. When this had been done, and the formula finally
drawn up, the magistrate had no more to do ; he was said ‘iudicium
dare,' the ‘r'es' was ‘in iudicium deducta ;' iudicium takes the place
ol ius. This stage in the proceedings, at which the action passed
from praetor to iudex, or, according to Roman ideas, at which it first
became an action at all, was called litis contestatio; no longera
solemn appeal to witnesses, but merely a name retained lor con-
venience sake from the older system to marlr a moment most eventlul
sor the parties, and attended by important consequences which are
described in detail hy Mr. Poste ¹.
