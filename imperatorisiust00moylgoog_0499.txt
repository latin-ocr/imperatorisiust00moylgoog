Poste on Gaius iii. rog and 162, maintains that, with the exception oi
stipulation, the only formal contract surviving in Justinian’s time‚B
could make any contractior A in the latter's name, so as to conset
rights on him alone and enable him alone to sue. This is based on
Dig. 41. r. 53 ‘eaquae civiliter adquiruntur per eos qui in potestate
nostra sunt adquirimus, veluti per stipulationem: quod naturaliter
adquiritur, sicuti est possessio,per quemlibet volentibus nobis possi·
dere adquirimus! But in this passage, as has been remarked hy
many writers, it is probable that its author, Modestinus, wrote manci-
pationem, not stipulationem, which the compilers of the Digest sub·
stituted ior it as being the only old formal disposition surviving in
their day; and it is clear, stom its position in the Title ‘De adquirendo
rerum dominio,’ that it does not relate to contracts at all, but only to
the question whether anything more than possession in a res corporalis
could be acquired per extraneam personam: see note on Bk. ii. 9. 5
supr. But aster all, perhaps the best criticism os this theory of Savigny's
is that of Mr. Hunter, that it the Roman law had really attained to a
true conception oi agency, the lact must have been patent in many
texts; whereas in point of lact its author is unable to support it hy
any really pertinent textual authority, except the very doubtful passage
last cited.

Consequeutly, the agent must make the contract in his own name:
and the desired effect-the conferring oi rights, and the impositiou os
duties‚ upon his principal-was first attained only aiter the introduc·
tion of the formulary procedure (Gaius iv. 86, 87) and iu a very cum·
brous and circuitous manner. Ii (eg.) A, being at Rome, wished to
buy a house belonging to C at Naples, he would give B (at Naples) a
mandate to buy it ior him. Bdoes so, and then assigns his rights
against C to A, ie. makes him his procurator in rem suam (ci. p. 465
supr.); C's rights against B, eg. his claim for the purchasemoney,
can he made avaiiable against A only hy anovatio: is this is not done,
C, il necessary, must recover from B hy actio venditi, and B from A by
actio mandati contraria. Here none ol the conditione above specified
are realized. A, so far from alone acquiring rights against C under
the contract, acquires them only indirectlyas his own agent's assignee;
C acquires rights against A, it at all, not by the contractos sale, but
hythe novation to which A is himself a party3 and B is in fact the
principal and true vendee throughout, and the only person who is en·
titled and bound in that capacity. In short, the desired effect is not
attained simply by A’s making B his agent, but bya double mandatum
and a novatio: A makes B his agent sor the proposed purchase fron
