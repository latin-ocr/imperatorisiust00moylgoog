Actions of this kind-in factum conceptae—form the great illustra ἶ

tion of the praetorian development of substantive through Adjectire
Law. The earliest mode in which the praetor conferred rights un·
known to the ius civile was by the employment of fictions. ilis
instructions to the iudex might be paraphrased thus: ‘The plaintiil
bas, by the civil law, no right whatever against the defendant3 but if,
supposing so and so were the fact, he would be entitled iure civili, then
lind for him in any case? sir Hemy hlaine has shown¹ why this ex-
pedient was at first adopted in preference to openly altering the law.
‘Fictions satisfy the desire for improvement, which is not quite wanting,
at the same tirne that they do not oliend the superstitious disrelish for
change which is always present. At a particular stage of social pro·
gress they are invaluable expediente for overcoming the rigidity ol
law? Eventually‚ however, the praetor discarded his original method,
and began to boldly grant independent actions in cases which bore no
analogy whatsoever to other relations already protected iure civili. The
intentio of such new actions could not allege a right in the plaintill,
forthere waS, ex hypothesi, no right by the civil law at all; but it could
allego a fact or facts, and the judge could be instructed to find for or
against the plaintiff according aa be ascertained the allegation to be
true or untrue ¹. Actiones infactum conceptae, in short, are not civil
law actions at all: they are all derived from the imperium of the magis·
, trate⁸. The formulae of those which were of most frequent occur-
rence were permanently incorporated in the album; on these others
were modelled‚ aud thus we get actiones in iactum directae, and ac·
tiones in factum utiles All, however, so far as we know hiem, are in
personam, fonning a third class of personal actions, co-ordinate with
stricti iuris and bonae fidei iudicia. The two latter are easily dis·
tinguishable from actiones in factum by their having an Intentio in
ius concepta—which contains, i. e. the word ‘oportere :’ but Savigny
is of opinion that the more equitable rules and free procedure of
bonae fidei actions were applied, so far as was possible, to actiones in
factum as well. Under some circumstances, indeed, a plaintiif might

³ Hence the division of actions into civiles (or legitimae) and honorariae (st
iv. 6. 3 supr), the latter being those which were referable solely to the imperium, end

had no foundation in the civil law at all, they oonsist of the two classes of actiones
utiles and in factum conceptae.
