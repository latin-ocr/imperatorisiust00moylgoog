the Republic they could issue edicts, which had a greater validity than
those of the old annual magistrates, because they held office for life :
but in theory their force died with them Thus, Dion Cassius (lvi. 28)
mentions a lex of nu. 12, by which it was provided that resolutions
arrived at by Augustus with the advice of his council should have the
force of a senatus consultum. The authority which Augustus pos·
sessed in virtue of his various offices was conferred on his successors
by separate leges; later, the emperor was invested with his powers
uno ictu, by a lex de imperio, after the analogy of the lex curiata of
the early legal period, which also gave his enactments the force of
statutes (Gaius i. 5) and released him from the control of the laws
(Dion Cassius liii. 18. 28). This lex de imperio is in lnst. i. 26
and other passages of the corpus iuris called lex regia, but it was
probably never so entitled before the third century, when to avoid the
comparison between rex and imperator would have been mere affec-
tation. An important fragment of the lex de imperio of Vespasian
(nu. 69) is extant; it empowers the emperor to conclude alliances,
procure senatus consulta, nominate the magistrates, extend the po·
moerium, and issue enactments with the forc'e of law. And so abso-
lute did theimperial authority become in the next 150 years, that
Ulpian could, early in the third century, speak of a complete devolution
of the power of the people to the emperor: 'Cum lege, quae de impe·
rio eius lata est, populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et po-
testatem conferat' (Dig. r. 4. 1 pn). The general term used to denote

law made either directly or indirectly by the emperor is constitutiones;
their various kinds are described in a note to Bk. i a. 6. Alter
Septimius Severus, in whose reign, as has been observed, the last of
the senatus consulta was enacted, the whole legislative authority of ’
the state concentrated itself in the hands of the emperor. Up to

the time of Constantine, however, the emperors legislated with
reference to specific cases of litigation, by decreta and rescripta,
far more than by direct and merely prospective enactment; and
such changes as were thus made in the law were far less compre-
hensive th'an those made by leges and senatus consulta. The period
in which direct imperial legislation was most active had yet to
come.

The distinction between the ius civile and the ius praetorium in no
way ceased with the introduction of the empire, but rather became
emphasised. Even had the office of praetor been suppressed, and the
edictum perpetuum ceased to appear, the development of the praeto·
rian law, in its peculiar character as a liberal and equitable system,
