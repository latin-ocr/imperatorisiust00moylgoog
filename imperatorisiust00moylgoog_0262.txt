Titia] bE EXHEREDATIONE LIBERORUM. 247

nominatim eas personas exheredare parentibus necesse erat,
sed licebat et inter ceteros hoc iacere.

Nominatim autem exheredari quis videtur, sive ita uthere-1
detur ‘Titius tilius meus exheres esto,’ sive ita ‘filius meus

form given in this section. As regards all sui and suae except sons, the
civil law was satisfied is, in desault of institution, they were disinherited
by a general clause (‘ ceteri exheredes sunto' Gaius ii. 128, which, ii Jus-
tinian in Cod 6. ah 4 is to be believed, would originally be enough for
sons as well). The civil law effect os pretermitting these was not (as in
the case oi a son) to avoid the will, but merely toentitle them to a share in
the succession varying with the character oi the instituted heir or heirs.
li these were sui, the praeteriti took share and share alike with them
(adcrescunt in virilem portionem) ; is extranei (Tit. ro 3ins.) they were ,
entitled to hali the inheritance ; for illustrations see Gaius ii. 124. An ex·
traneus, however, who was instituted heir in awill in which such persons
were praeteriti, was more hardly treated by the praetor, who gave the
praeteriti bonorum possessio (contra tabulas) oi the whole, ‘qua ratione
extranei heredes a tota hereditate repelluntur’ Gaius ii. 125; buta re·
script ol M. Aurelius again curtailed the rights oi suae praeteritae by
enacting that they should in no case talre more by bonorum possessio
contra tabulas than they would have taken hythe ius adcrescendi oi the
civil law (ib. 126); the effect os this was to augment the rights oi pre·
termitted sui not in the first degree (e. g. grandsons).

The praetor, not satisfied with the civil law rules oi exheredation in
respect oi persons in the testator's power, required all sui-grandsons,
greatgrandsons, etc, no less than sons, to be disinherited nominatim, pro·
mising them in detault bonorum possessio contra tabulas (Gaius ii. ¹²9) ;
according to which, though the will remained sormally valid, the inherit-
ance was divided among all the sui, whether instituted or pretermitted,
as under the rules oi intestacy, Dig. 37. 4 rr. 1, ih. 8. 4. Το summarise
what has been said-unless instituted

(1) Sui filii must he disinherited nominatim ; else the will is void, and
theman dies intestate.

(2) Other sui may (a) iure civili be disinherited inter ceteros; in de·
fault, they are entitled either to the ius adcrescendi orto hali the inherit·
auce ; (b) iure praetorio, they must be disinherited nominatim ; in deiault,
if the institutus is extraneus, they can get bonorum possessio oi the whole ;
as against instituted sui they are entitled to have the bona distributed
‘tanquam intestatus decessisset?

(3) Suae oi whatever grade may be disinherited by a general clause :
in deiault (a) iure civili, the will is not void, but they are entitled to
the ius adcrescendi; (b) iure praetorio, they could claim bonorum pos·
sessio of the whole against an extraneus heres until the rescript ot'
M. Aurelius, when the older law (by which they got halt') was in effect
restored
