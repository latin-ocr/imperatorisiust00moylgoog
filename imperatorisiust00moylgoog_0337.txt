hence no one can stand in this relation to a mere right (p. ²09 supr).
The right to interdicts, however, was grounded upon a disturbance in
some unlawiul manner of the exercr'se of ownership, and the exercise
oi other rights, as well as that of ownership, cau be unlawlully dis-
turbed ; so that it seemed only logical that here too unwarranted
interference should be guarded munst by the same remedius. Accord-
ingly, the enjoyment ol iura in re aliena was protected by possessory
interdicts; they were deemed to be quasi-possessed (‘ iuris quasi pos·
sessio' Dig. 8. '5. 10, ‘possessionem vel corporis vel iuris ’ Dig. 43. 26.
a. 3). The expressiones savigny remarks, is an improper extension
oi analogical language3 quasi possessio indicates the exercise of a ius
in re aliena, ‘being related to the latter in the same way as possession
stricto sensu is to dominium. Nor is it possible to ‘detain' an object
which, though corporeal, is indeterminate, such as an uncertain por-
tion os a thing. llnally, the idea of detention being that oi exclusive
physical control, we have the rule ‘plures eandem rem in solidum
possidere uon possunt;' i. e. if we read that a previously existing
possession (and asoro'orz' detention) still continues, no new possession
(and'afortt'ort'detention) can possibly have commenced ; and con·
versely, il the law recognises a nevvpossession, the previous possession
mu'st have ceased to exist.

'When to this Detention is superadded a further (mental) clement, it
becomes Possession, an interest protected by special legal remedies,
viz. interdicas. 'That mental clement is the intentionum the part ol
the dominer, oi dealing with the thing detained as owner3 of exercis-
ing over it, ou his own behals, the rights which an owner exerclses on
his. This intention is usually called the animus domini or sibi
habendi3 the'phmse does 'not occur in the authorities, the nemest
approach to it being Theophilus’ simeoni lost τὸψνχῇ δεσπόζοντος κατ-
έχειν. It should eareiully be marked, that it isan intention; it nas
'nothing to do with a belief that one is owner (opinio or cogitatio
domini), sor the possessing thies or robber is as capable of the animus
domini as the most innooent possessor, and is as sully entitled to the
protection of interdicta as the latter3 ‘adversus extraneos vitiosa
possessio* prodesse solet' Dig. 41. a. 53. In other words, possession
is independent ol bona fides: ‘it is possession, whether iusta or iniustas
the ius possessionis, the right involved in possession, the right pro-
tected by interdicte, is quite distinct from and independent ol the ius
possidendi, or right to possess, which belongs not to the law ol pos·
sessionum oi ownership.
