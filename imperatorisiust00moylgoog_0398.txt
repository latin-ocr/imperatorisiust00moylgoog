Tit.14.] QUIBUS MODIS RE CONTRAHITUR OBLIGATIO. 383

dubium non est, quin de restituenda ea re tenearis: com·
modata autem res tune proprie intellegitur, si nulla mercede
accepta vel constituta res tibi utenda data est. alioquin
mercede interveniente locatus tibi usus rei videtur: gratuitum
enim debet esse commodatum. Praeterea et is, apud quem3
res aliqua deponitur, re obligatur et actione depositi, qui et
ipse de ea re quam accepit restituenda tenetur. sed is ex eo
solo tenetur, si quid dolo commiserit, culpae autem nomine,
id est desidiae atque neglegentiae, non tenetur: itaque securus

sonable care (diligentia, lor which see Excursus Vl at the end oi this
Book) were (1) to restore the object lent at the time agreed upon, or so
soon as the purpose ior which it was lent was satisfied: it could be re-
demanded earlier only upon breach oi another general tenn ol the con-
tract, viz. (2) to use it only sor the purpose lor which it was lent: to use
it ior others was thest, if the borrower was aware that the other would
not have permitted it, Bk. iv. 1. 6-8 inf, (3) to return it in as good con·
dition as when received, excepting such deterioration as naturally results
from its use, οι· as might reasonably have been expected: ‘si reddita
quidem sit res commodata, sed deterior reddita, non videtur reddita, quae
deterior sacta redditur, nisi quod interest praestetur: proprie enim dicitur
res non reddita quae deterior redditur' Dig. 13. 6. 3. 1: lor the excep-
tione see ib. 23, and ς. 7, cited in Hunter's Roman Law p. 302, (4) to
restore not only it, but also any gain which he may have made by using
it in a manner not authorized by the contract, Dig. ib. 13· 1.

Like depositum, pignus, and mandatum, commodatum is said to be an
imperiectly bilateral contract: i. e. as a general rule, only one ol the
parties (the borrower) is bound, and only one (the lender) is entitled.
But very often a liability ol the latter will arise from circumstances pos· ⁴
terior to the contract itsell ε thus, in commodatum, though (4) supr.
implies that all ordinary expenses in connection with the object lent must
be borne by the borrower, the lender will be bound to indemnify him lor
any extraordinary costs necessarily incurred: e. g. ‘quicquid in rem com-
modatam ob morbum vel aliam rationem impensum est a domino recipi
potest’ Paul. sent. rec. 2. 4. 1 : or for any injury caused by it to the bor-
rower or his property, is this can be attributed to the fault ol the lender:
eg. Dig. 13. 6. 22. These duties can be enforced against the lender
either by retentio (lien) or by actio commodati (contraria).

§a Like commodatum, depositum was a gratuitous contract: in the
absence ol special agreement, the depositary's duties were as follow: (1)
to take the same care ol the res deposita as he took os his own: ‘nisi
tamen ad suum modum curam in deposito praestat, fraude non caret:
nec enim salva fide minorem his quam suis rebus diligentiam praestabit'
Dig. 16. 3. 32, hence he was not answerable it the property was stolen, ,ι
though as a rule it was presumed that allowing theit argued absence ol
diligentia exacta, Dig. 17. 2. 52. 3: (2) to retum it in as good condition
