2id quod sibi naturaliter debetur. Fideiussor non tantum ipse
aobligatun sed etiam heredem obligatum relinquit. Fideiussor
4et praecedere obligationem et sequi potest. Si plures sint
fideiussores, quotquot erunt numero, singuli in solidum te-
nentur. itaque liberum est creditori a quo velit solidum
petere. sed ex epistula divi Hadriani compellitur creditor a
singulis, qui modo solvendo sint litis contestatae tempore,
partes petere. ideoque si quis ex fideiussoribus eo tempore
solvendo non sit, hoc ceteros onerat. sed et si ab uno
fideiussore creditor totum consecutus fuerit, huius solius de·
trimentum erit, si is pro quo fideiussit solvendo non sit: et
sibi imputare debet, cum potuerit adiuvari ex epistula divi
Hadriani et desiderare, ut pro parte in se detur actio

he would be bound sor the sponsio 01 a slave or peregrinus, which would
be void also, Gaius iii. 119.

§8. By saying that a fideiussor ‘praecedere obligationem potest’ is
meant only that a man may on the occurrence 01 some event in the
future become fideiussor nolens volens, not that he is obligatus before
the principal debtor is. 11 the contract were in the form ‘id quod mihi A
debebit, fide tua esse iubesi’ the promisor was not bound at once; but
if A subsequently became the promisee’s debtor, then the fideiussor was
bound; the promise was in effect made subject to a suspensive con-
dition: for the legal position in such cases see on Tit. 15. 4 supr. ;
cs. ξ 5 inf.

§4. Two or more fideiussors never enjoyed the benefits 01 the leges
Apuleia and F uria ; any one 01 them was liable to be sued for the whole
debt, and isso sued must pay the whole 01 it. Under the socalled
beneficium divisionis, which was introduced by the epistola Hadriani,
he was enabled, when sued‚ to demand that is the other fideiussore were
solvent the creditor should divide his claim between him and thern, this
demand taking the form 01 an exceptio to the plaintiffls contentiori : ‘si
contendat fideiussor caeteros solvendo esse, etiam exceptionem ei dan·
dam, “si non et illi solvendo sint ’³’ Dig. 46. 1. 28 ; so that on the general
rule‚ the burden 01 proving their solvency lay on the defendant: cf. Cod.
4. 19. 3. Thus he was not in so favourable a position as the sponsor and
fidepromissor under the two statutes referred to; sor the liability was
not divided between him and the other fideiussore ipso iure, so that he
would still have to pay the whole debt is (under the formulary procedure)

’ he neglected to get the exceptio inserted in the formula 01 the action, or
is all the others were insolvent; in other words, his liability was affected
by the insolvency of the rest, that 01 a sponsor or fidepromissor (at any
rate in Italy) was not.

11 one fideiussor paid the whole debt, he still bad a remedy against the
