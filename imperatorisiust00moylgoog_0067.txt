opinion cited by his adversam, and evento involve the judge in
perplexity with an array oi responsa and citations oi which no single
⁵ one agreed precisely with any oi the rest. lt would seem that
Hadrian expressly extended the usage which was established in
respect ol responsa ¹proper to citatione from systematic works; at
least such seems the natural inierence from Gaius i. 7 ‘Responsa

pmdentium sunt sententiae et opiniones eorum quibus permissum est
jura condere; quorum omniurn si in unum sententiae concurrant, id
quod ita sentiunt legis vicem obtinet; si vero dissentiunt, iudici licet
quam velit sententiam sequi, idque rescripto divi Hadriani significatur!

It will be observed that in this explanation oi the passage a wide
meaning is given to the expression ‘responsa prudentium,' which is
taken to mean the juristic writings in general ol those ‘quibus per·
missum est iura condere ς’ an explanation which seems to be warranted
by Theophilus, who (Paraphr. i. a. 8), speaking ol law made by
the prudentes, says, τὸ δι’ παρ’ οὔτῶν νομοθετούμενοι* γενικῷ ὀνόματι κέκληται
‘responsum prudentium,’ and by Papinian's general use of the phrase
‘auctoritas prudentium’ to denote any statements or records from
which the opinions of jurists could be collected. But Savigny
(System i. 'p 156) gives responsa herea strictly literal interpretation,
and ii his view is right no inlerence can be drawn hom the passage
asto the judicial procedure when the parties to a suit supported their
respective allegatione by citing diverse views stom the writings oi
iuris auctores.

The end ol jurisprudence is in general the same as that os all
science; a complete grasp, ο, systematic penetration of its subject·
matter; the power oi following the most general propositions into
their minutest ramifications, and inversely oi ascending from the most
concrete case, through all intermediate stages ol thought, to the prin-
ciple which governs it This grasp and this power belonged in an
admirable degree to the Roman y'un'sts; their highest qualities are
their mastery of their subject, their wonderful capacity oi regarding
and deciding every concrete case with reference to some rule, and
their logical subsumption ol all their rules under a comparatively
small number oi great legal principles Accordingly, in some re-
spects their legal method lest⁸nothing to be desired. But from
another point oi view the Roman Jurisprudence is more open to
criticism. The cause may be disputed; it may have been the back·
ward state of general scientific knowledge, or the exclusion oi the
y'urists from all other departments of politioal lil'e: but certain it is
that their absorption in their peculiar study blinded them to the ‚fact
