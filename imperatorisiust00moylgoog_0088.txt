LATER HISTORl' OF THE ROMAN LAW. 73

‘novellae constitutiones ε’ ‘Si quid in posterum melius inveniatur et
ad constitutionem necessario sit redigendum, hoc a nobis et constitu-
atur, et in aliam congregationem referatur, quae novellamm nomine
constitutionum significetur’ (Just. in Cod. cordi nobis, § 4). The first
of Justinian's Novels was enacted very shortly after the publication of
the Code; their total number was at least 165, but they were never
authoritatively collected and published in a connected form by their
author. Though most of them relate to administrative business and
ecclesiastical matters, there are some by which individual institutione
of private law were entirely remodelled; the most important of these
will be noticed in the commentary below.

The subsequent history of the Roman law in the West and East,
the labour which the glossatore and the modern civilians have spent
upon its interpretation, and the acumen with which, especially in Ger-
many, they have adapted it to modern social conditions, is too large a
subject to be here entered into; all that can be done is very briefly to
explain the form in which the Justinian legislation at present exists in
the countries where it still possesses the force of law. Since Diony-
sius Gothofredus, in 1583, published it in its entirety with the name
‘Corpus iuris civille,' this has been regarded as its proper technical
title, especially in contradistinction to the ‘Corpus iuris Canonici,' or

Canon law. As positive law, Justinian's three great compilations‚ the
Institutes, the Digest, and the Code (along with the Novels their na-

tural appendix), form a system apart by itself, and as such they were
viewed by the glossators, who divided them into five volumes, each
distinguished by a separate name. The first three volumes comprised
the Digest, and were known respectively as Digestum vetus, infortia-
tum, and novum. ln the Digestum vetus was contained the Digest up
to Book 24, Title 25 it thus ended with the title ‘de divortiis et
repudiis? The ‘infortiatum’ began with the third title of Book 24,
aud ended with Book 38. The Digestum novum contained the
remaining books (39-50) of the Digest of justinian. The fourth
volume of the glossators' corpus iuris comprised the Code, with the
exceptiones Books ro-12‚ which were not discovered till later, and was
entitled ‘Codex repetitae praelectionis3’ the fifth (called ‘volumen par-
vum’ or ‘volumen’ simply) contained the Institutes, and, eventually,
also the last three books of the Code.

This division into five volumes is stili found in the oldest editions
of the Corpus iuris; but in the more modern ones, in which it is dis·
carded‚ the Institutes are placed first, and are followed by the Digest,
the Code, and the Novels in the order named. Many of these
