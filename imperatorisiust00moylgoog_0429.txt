4¹4 nvsrrwrrolvvw arani QUATTUOR. [ta. m.

icausa habet curn eo mandati iudicium. Graece fideiussor
plerumque ita accipitur: τῇ ἐμῇ πίστει κελεύω, λέγω, θέλω sive
βούλομαιε sed et si φημί dixerit, pro eo erit, ac si dixerit λέγω.
tlIn stipulationibus fideiussorum sciendum est generaliter hoc

produced him within a time fixed by the judge, he could be sued
himself.

The modes in which a fideiussor’s liability was terminated are

(1) Extinction of the principal debt in any of the modes enumerated in
Tit. 29 and notes inf, Dig. 46. 3. 43; 12. 28. 1 ; 34. 3. 5. pr. lt is only
under very exceptional circumstances that the suretyremains bound after
the principal obligation has ceased to exist. Even where he himself bad
brought about its extinction by rendering its performance impossible, the
jurists at first were unable to admit the continuance of his own liability
ex contractu, though they held him liable to the actio de dolo, Dig. 4. 3.
19 : but later a utilis actio ex stipulatu was allowed in lieu of this, which
eventually became directa: in other words, the continuing liability was
recognised So too if the principal debtor died, leaving no successor,
the surety remained bound, Dig. 46. 3. 95. 5, Cod 8. 41. 1. lf the cre-
ditor was unable to sue the principal with any effect, because, though the
obligatio was not extinguished, the latter could always. repel him by an
exceptio, the surety was usually able to use that exceptio himself, for the
reason stated in Bk. iv. 14. 4 inf. Among the defences of this class
which he could use are exceptio pacti, loc. cit: ‘exceptio iuris iurandi’
Dig. 12. 2. 28. 1, and the plea of prescription. The following exceptiones,
however, though open to the debtor, were not also open to the surety:
(a) those which were purely personal to the former, Dig. 44. 1. 7. pr.;
eg. ‘beneficii competentiae' Dig. loc. cit, ‘pacti de non petendo in
personam' Dig. 2. 14 22, ‘nisi bonis cesserit’ Bk iv. 14. 4. inf: the last
for the very reason that ‘is qui alios pro debitore obligat hoc maxime
prospicit, ut curn facultatibus lapsus fuerit debitor, possit ab iis, quos pro
eo obligavit, suurn consequi :’ the ver‘yend of suretyship would otherwise
be defeated. Similarly, if the principal debtor was a minor, and could
plead that he had been in integrum restitutus, the fideiussor was not
benefited if the creditor had taken him for the express purpose of pro·
tecting himself against this eventuality, Dig. 4. 4. 13. pr. (b) Such ex·
ceptions as left a naturalis obligatio still subsisting, e. g. that SC¹. Mace-
doniani, unless the surety had regressus against the principal debtor,
Dig. 14. 6. 9. 3.

(2) Confusio, or concurrence of the main and accessory liability in the
same person: ‘generaliter lulianus ait eum, qui heres extitit ei pro quo
intervenerat, liberari ex causa accessionis et solummodo quasi heredem
rei teneri’ Dig. 46. r. 5.

(3) lf the priucipal debtor fraudulently evaded his obligation, or squarr-
dered his means, the fideiussor corild demand bis release, Dig. 17. 1. 38.
1, Cod. 4. 35. ro
‚§8. Cf. Tit. 19· 17 supr.
