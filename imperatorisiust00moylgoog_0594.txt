m. ῐ3,η os EXCEPTJONJBUS. 579

agitur. Verbi gratia si metu coactus aut dolo inductus autl
errore lapsus stipulanti Titio promisisti, quod non debueras
promittere, palam est iure civili te obligatum esse et actio,
qua intenditur dare te oportere, efficax est: sed iniquum est
te condemnari ideoque datur tibi exceptio metus eausa aut
doli mali aut in sactum composita ad impugnandam actionem.
Idem iuris est, si quis quasi credendi causa pecuniam stipu·2

§L For the introduction ol the exceptio quod metus causa by the
praetor Octavius see on Tit. 6. 33 supr. Α person who bad been induced
· by intimidation to make any disposition (and not merely a contram, as
might hastily be inserted from the text; see Gaius iv. 117) could either
bring the actio quod metus causa (Tit. 6. 27 supr.) by which he might
recover penal damages lor any loss he had suffered, or he could repel
any action brought against him on the disposition by the exceptio (which,
however, was not necessary in bonae fidei actions, Cod. 4. 44 8), or
finally he might get himself in integrum restitutus. With ‘palam est iure
civili te obligatum esse' in the text we may compare Dig. 4 2. 21. 5 ‘si
metu coactus adii hereditatem, puto heredem me effici, quamvis si liberum
esset noluissem, tamen coactus volui!

What has been said of metus may, mutatis mutandis, be repeated oi
dolus ; see the note on Tit. 6. 33 referred to. Here the fraud had to be
alleged specifically against the plaintiff in the exceptio; ‘et quidem
illud adnotandum est, quod specialiter exprimendum est, de cuius
dolo quis queratur, non in rem, “si in ea re nihil dolo malo factum est,'’
sed sic ‘⁴ si in ea re nihil dolo malo actoris factum est '’‘ Dig. 44 4. 2. 1 ;
cl. (ol the actio doli) ‘in haec actione designari oportet cuius dolo
iactum sit, quamvis in metu non sit necesse' Dig. 4. 3. 15. 3. Where to
‘nihil dolo malo laetum est’ was added ‘neque fiat' (as in Gaius iv. 119)
the exceptio was said to be generalis.

1r the defendant’s plea was not one os the commoner kinds which had
received specific names, it briefly stated the facts upon which he relied,
and was then said to be in lactum composita: ‘in iactum λέγεται ἐπειδὴ
διηγηματικῶς τὸ γενόμενον ἀνατίθησιν Theophilus ; so, too, Gaius describes
formulae in iactum conceptae by saying ‘nominato eo quod lactum est’
ι iv. 4⁶3 for an example see fragm. Vat. 310 ‘si non donationis causa
mancipavi vel promisi me daturum? ln a loose sort olway these excep·
tiones in facturn were comprised under the exceptio doli r ‘generaliter
sciendum est ex omnibus in factum exceptionibus doli oriri exceptionem,
quia dolo iacit, quicunque id quod quaqua exceptione elidi potest petit’
Dig. 44. 4. a. 5. lt may be, however, that the contrast is merely the
old one between in ius and infactum, the judge's attention being directed
in some exceptiones to a question merely oi law (e. g. ‘si in ea re nihil
contra legem Cinciam iactum sit' fragm. Vat. 310); this, as Keller
remarks (Civil Process ξ 3 5), would make most exceptions in sactum.

ξ 8. The appropriate deseuce in this case is said by Gaius (iv. 116) to
