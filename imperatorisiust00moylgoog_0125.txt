QUI EX QUIBUS CAUSIS MANUMlTTERE NON POSSUNT.

Non tamen cuicumque volenti manumittere licet. narn is
quiin fraudem crerhtorum manumittit nihil agit, quia lex
lAelia Senti'a impedit libertatem. Licet autem domino, qui
solvendo non est, testamento servum suum cum libertate
heredem instituere, ut hat liber heresque ei solus et neces·
sarius, si modo nemo alius ex eo testamento heres extiterit,
aut quia nemo heres scriptus sit, aut quia isqui scriptus est
qualibet ex eausa heres non extiterit. idque eadem lege
Aelia Sentia provisum est et rectervalde enim* prospiciendum
erat, ut egentes homines, quibus alius heres extaturus non
esset, vel servum suum necessarium heredem habeant, qui
satisfacturus esset creditoribus, aut hoc eonon. faciente credi·

forbade them to live within one hundred miles of Rome under penalty
of becoming slaves again without possibility ofa subsequent manumis-
sion ; and their property on decease went to their patron, Gaius iii. 74·-
76. This dediticia libertas was practically obsolete¹ before Justinian
(ι nec in usu esse reperimus' Cod. 7. 5), and was formallyabolished by him,
as is stated in this section. (2) It placed restrictions. on manumissione
by masters less than twenty years of age, Tit. 6. 4 inf. ; and'also (3) pro·
vided that no slave under thirty years of age should be enfranchised
so as to become a civis libertus unless· the manumission were by vin-
dicta, and an adequate motive were proved before a oouncil at Rome,
and in the provinces. before a body of twenty recuperatores; Gaius
i. 18520. This provision was repealed by Justinian 3 see this paragraph,
ad fin. (4) It invalidated manumissions in fraud of creditore ; see Tito
pr. inf. ρ

lt was said above that a Latinus could in certain ways become a
civis 3 there were also modes in which a· libertus could become ingenuus,
one of which, operative only under the old law, has been noticed in the
note on§ 1 supr. Ingenuitas, however, could be conferred by imperial
grant (‘ natalibus restitui’ Dig. 40. 11. 2); and by the acquisition from
the emperor of the ‘ius aureorum anulorum’ a· freedman became in·
genuus during his lifetime, but could not prejudice his patron's rights
of succession; Dig. 38. 2. 3. pn, fragm. Vat. 226, Dig.40.,1n 6. By
Nov. 78.1and 2 Justinian bestowed the ius anulorum on all freed·
men and freedwomen whatsoever: ‘si quis manumittens servum aut
ancillam suam . . . qui hbertatem acceperit, habebit et aureorum anu-
lorum et regenerationis ius.’

Tit. v1. For the term ‘heres necessarius,' and the purpose of insti·
tuting one's own slave, see Bk. ii. 19. 1 inf.
