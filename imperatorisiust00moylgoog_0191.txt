176 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK II.

system is concemed, the only divisione of res which are of primary
importance are, first, that into res corporales and incorporales, and,
second, that into res singulae and universitates. Res corporales hav·
ing been defined (G. ii. ¹3, Inst. ii. 2. ι) as tangible objecta, and such
tangible objects as cannot be in singulorum dominio having already
been excluded, the modes in which ownership (and incidentally pos·
¹ session) of them can be acquired, natural (Tit. r) aud civil (Tit. 6.
and 7), are explained. Res incorporales having been defined (G. ii.
14, Inst ii. 2. 2), the nature of some of them (viz. servitudes) and
their modes of acquisition are described in Titles 3-5: others, viz.

obligations, occupy the greater portion of the third Boolc These are
all res singulae: universitates and their modes of vesting are examined

> under the heads of hereditas, whether testamentary (ii. ιο-25) οι

intestate (iii. 1-9), adrogation (iii. 10), and bonorum addictio libertatis
causa (iii. ιι).

Spealring briefly, then, the ius quod ad res pertinet, extending over
the whole of the second and third Books and part of the fourth Book
of the institutes, treats of tangible external objects of property, with
their titles; real rights over them of less orbit than dominium; inherit·
ance, comprising the subiect of legacies: two less considerable forms
of universal succession3 and finally obligations, under the two heads of
contracta and delicts or torts. All these are ‘res ;' the question still
remains, What is the common property in virtue of which they are
. classed together, and the law relating to thern set apart as one of the
three great departments of the private code? To this question Mr.
Poste (Gaius p. 159), following Austin, answers that the law relating
to res is set apart because it is the law of equal rights. By this be
appears to mean, that in it all persons are regarded as equal, in the
sense that exactly the same capacity of right and of disposition is
ascribed to all, and that differences in such capacity are leit out of
sight, as belonging properly to the law of Persons or unequal rights.
If thiais his meaning, we cannot but reject it as entirely misleading.
The division of law into law of equal and law of unequal rights is no
older than Austin, and to attribute an acquaintance with it to Gaius is
a mere anachronism. If by the ius quod ad res pertinet Gaius had
meant to express the law of equal rights, he would not, in it, have
noticed incapacities of disposition (as he does in ii. 47. 80 sq: cf. Inst.
ii. 8. 2), incapacities of right (as he does in ii. 87 sq: cf. Inst. ii. 9. ι
and 2), disabilities in certain classes to take benefits ola particular
kind (as he does in ii. ιιι) οι exceptione from the ordinary mles for

the execution of testaments (ii. 109, Inst. ii. rr): it would be super·
