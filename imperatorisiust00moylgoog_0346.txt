tutes were published, the three distinct bodies ol rules relating to one
subject still coexisted side by side: the successor ol an intestata might
base his claim on the Twelve Tables, on the Edict, or on some enact·
ment of the later civil law ς in the second case, it is true, he was not
technioelly heres, but, as we have already seen, his rights were sub-
stantially identical with those ola civil law successor. Cases were
even still to be found, in which agnatio relationship entitled a claimant
to prion'ty over others who, il cognation alone were considered, would·
at least take with him pari passu. It was not unnatural that Justinian
should be dissatisfied with his work, and by a Novel issued in the year
rr. n. 543 he substituted sor the system ol succession which has here
been sketcheda new scheme based entirely upon blood relationship,
ol· which an account ie given in the notes to Title 9. 9.

Two other modes ‘quibus res per universitatem adquiruntur,'
though ol lar less interest and importance than inheritance, are
described in Titles ro and rr. The first ol these is the type ol adop·
tion known as adrogation. When a person sui iuris gave himself in
adoption to another, his universitas iuris passed, under the law as
previously settled, to the latter; but the development ol the lilius-
farnilias' proprietary capacity had infringed upon the necessity of this ’
ruia, and Justinian‚ as he himself remarks, limited the adrogator’s
right in accordance with the principle which he had already estab-
lished in the second hook. The liability ol the adrogatur lor debts
contracted by the adopted son while sui iuris- is treated in the last
paragraph ol the Title. The last remaining form ol universal succes·
Δ sion, which was introduced by a constitution ol Marcus Aurelius, was
aprovision ‘favore libertatis,' to secure the freedom ol slaves who
had been manumitted in a will under which no heres accepted, and
enabled any one who would give the creditore lull security lor the
satisfaction ol their claime to have the estate adjudged to him, thus
putting it in his power, as quasi heir, to iulfil the intentions os the
deceased.

Title ra brielly touches on two universal successions obsolete under
Justinian’s legislation; the one the peculiar form of bankruptcy execu-
tion known as bonorum emptio -a subject which is more fully
discussed in a note on the text; the other introduced by the SC.
Claudianum, ol' which we have already read, and which, with its con·
sequences‚ was repealed by Justinian in person.

From this subject we pass at Title 13 to the consideration ol the
immrtant class ol res incorporales called obligations. An obligation
is a legal relation between two ascertained persons, in virtue ol which
