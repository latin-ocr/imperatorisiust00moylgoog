express, Dig. 29. 7. 2. 4 ; though such confirmation, and also pupillsry
substitutions made by codicils, would be upbeld by a ‘benignior interpre-
tatio' as fideicommissa, Dig. loc. cit.; 36. 1. 76. So too the heir's name,
which the testator had omitted or suppressed in awill, might be supplied
in later codicilli, Dig. 28. 5. 77: aud in the same ways testator might
declare the institutus oi an earlier will indignus, whereby his portion was
forfeited to the fiscus, Cod. 6. 35.4 Soldiers were exempted from the
restrictions of this section‚ Dig. 29. 1. 36. pr.

ξ 3. The statement oi the text that codicilli were subject to no require·
ments oi form is misleading: all that it means is that they could be ex·
pressed in any phrase or language. Constantine prescribed ior intestate,
and Theodosius ll lor all codicils the same number and qualification of
witnesses as were necessary for a testament Under Justinian they had
to be signed by the maker before at least five witnesses, Cod. 6. 23 28. 1,
and to be signed and scaled by the latter in his presence ε many writers,
however, hold that sealing was unnecessary. li these lonnalities were
not complied with, the procedure described in Tit. 23. 12 supr. might still
be appealed to, so lar as the would-be codicils could be construed as
creating a fideicommissum.
