casuri sunt. Cum autem in compluribus aliis causis postumi4
pro iam natis habentur, et in hac causa placuit non minus
postumis quam iam natis testamento tutores dari posse, si
modo in ea causa sint, ut, si vivis parentibus nascerentur, sui
et in potestate eorum tierent. Sed si emancipato lilio tutor5
a patre testamento datus fuerit, confirmandus est ex sententia
praesidis omnimodo, id est sine inquisitione.

Dari autem potest tutor non solum pater familias, sed
etiam filius familias. Sed et servus proprius testamentol

§4 Postumi liberi are children born after the execution of the will:
whether aster the death of the testator or in his life-time is immaterial.
Α paterfamilias could not give a testamentary guardian to a posthumous
grandson, if, supposing be had died immediately after the execution of
the will, the grandson would have been born in the potestas of his own
father, the testator's son: for in that case, the father being in the same
potestas, the child would not have been a suus heres to the testator.
Guardianship was only intended as a substitute for patria potestas, and
the existence of the latter barred the possibility of the former.

§ 6. There were five other cases in which magisterial confirmation of
a testamentary appointment was required, viz. (ι) where a father gave
by will a guardian to his natural child, Dig. 26. 3. 73 (2) where the ap-
pointment vas made in unconfirmed codicils or in an invalid will, Dig. ib.
1.t; (3) where the appointment violated the SC. Libonianum by being
written by the guardian himself3 here a ‘praevia inquisitio' was neees-
sary, Dig. ib. 2. 29: 48. 10.18. 13 (4) where a mother attempted to
give a testamentary guardian to her child, the appointment would be
confirmed only ‘ex inquisitione,' and only if the child were instituted
heir in the vill, Dig. ib. 24 ; (5) if a man appointed a testamentary
guardian to the child of some other person, the appointment would be
confirmed ex inquisitione if the child were instituted heir in the will, and
had no other property, Dig. ib. 3. 4. 5. ln all these cases, or at any rate .
where an inquisitio was held, the appointment was deemed magisteria!
rather than testamentary, Dig. ib. 2. 26. 2: 48. ro.18. 1.

att XIV. The two main rules of testamentary appointments are,
(ι) there must be testamentifactio (Ble ii. 19. 4 inf.) between testator
and the intended guardian, Dig. 26. 2. 21, and (2) the person must be
clearly specified, Blr. ii. 20. 27 inf.
