linia] QUIBUS MODIS IUS POTESTATIS SOLVITUR. 137 ⁰

l hoc in melius per constitutionem reformavit, ut fictione pristina
explosa recta via apud competentes iudices vel magistratus
parentes intrent et filios suos vel filias vel nepotes vel neptes
ac deinceps sua manu dimitterent et tunc ex edicto praetoris

-in huius filii vel filiae, nepotis vel neptis bonis, qui vel quae a
parente manumissus vel manumissa fuerit, eadem iura prae·
stantur parenti, quae tn'buuntur patrono in bonis liberti: et
praeterea si impubes sit filius vel filia vel ceten', ipse parens ex
manumissione tutelam eius nanciscitur. Admonendi autema
sumus liberum esse arbitrium ei, qui filium et ex eo nepotem
vel neptem in potestate habebit, filium quidem de potestate
dimittere, nepotem vero vel neptem retinere: etex diverso

fied: (n) The consent of the pater3 the general rule is stated in § 9 inf,
to which a few exceptions are noticed in Dig. r. 7. 3²· 33 ; ²7· ro. 16 ; 35.
r. 92; 37. η 1-2, ib. 5. (2) The consent of the child: it was sufficient,
however, if be did not protest against the emancipation: ‘solvere ius
potestatis invitis liliis non est permissum patribus’ N ov. 89. ιι pr. (3) Due
performance of the act of emancipation. This, as described by Gaius
(i. 132), was affected by the pater's mancipating the child to afriend fidu·
riae causa, who remancipated him to the pater, and by the latter’s then
manumitting him, like a slave, vindicta If it were ason three mancipa-
tions were necessary, owing to the rule of the XII Tables, ‘si pater lilium
ter wenumduit, a patre lilius liber esto ε’ after each of the two first man-
cipations be was manumitted hythe alienee, whereby he again fell
under the patria potestas ; tbe third mancipation was made curn fiducia,
aud was followed by remancipation to, and manumission by, the eman·
cipating father, unless the remancipation were dispensed with, and the
child were actually manumitted by tbe alienee, usually under an agree·
ment to hold the iura patronatus in trust for the father; see on Blr. iii. a.
8 inf. For this dumsy form Justinian substituted (Cod. 8. 49 6) a
simple declaration before a judge or magistrate, which was registered in
the acta. ‘Recta wia,' in the text, is explained by Cod. 8. 49.6 ‘sine
sacro rescripto,' a reference to emancipation by irnperial rescript, which
was introduced by Anastasius (Cod. loc. cit. 5), and was mainly resorted
to when absence of the child prevented the old form from being em-
ployed. For the effect of emancipation on filiusfamilias' property see
Ble ii. o 2, and notes ini: he was allowed to retain his peculium pro-
fectitium unless it was expressly talren from him, fragm. Vat. 25 5. 261. Of
the iura patronatus, said in the text to have been given to the emanci-
pating pater by the edict, the most important was the right of succession,
guaranteed by the praetor through the system of bonorum possessio ; see
Bk iii. 2. 6 inf, and Dig. 37. 12. 1. r.
