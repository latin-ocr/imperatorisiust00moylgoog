Tito] PER QUAS PERSONAS NOBIS ADQUIRITUR. 231

fruetur pro tertia dimidia potiturus. Item vobis adquiritur,3
quod servi vestri ex traditione nanciscuntur sive quid stipu-
lentur vel ex qualibet alia causa adquirunt. hoc enim vobis

et ignorantibus et invitis obvenit. ipse enim servus qui in
potestate alterius est nihil suurn habere potest. sed si heres
institutus sit, non alias nisi iussu vestro hereditatem adire
potest: et si iubentibus vobis adierit, vobis hereditas adquiri-
tur, perinde ac si vos ipsi heredes instituti essetis. et con·
venienter scilicet legatum per eos vobis adquiritur. non solum
autem proprietas per eos quos in potestate habetis adquiritur
vobis,sed etiarn possessio: cuiuscumque enim rei possessionem ¹
adepti fuerint, id vos possidere videmini. unde etiam per eos
usucapio vel longi temporis possessio vobis accedit. De his4
autern servis, in quibus tanturn usum {nictum habetis, ita
placuit, ut, quidquid ex re vestra vel err operibus suis adquir-
ant, id vobis adiciatur, quod vero extra eas causas persecuti
sunt, id ad dominum proprietatis pertineat. itaque si is servus

Ι heres institutus sit legatumve quid ei aut donatum fuerit, non .

usufructuario, sed domino proprietatis adquiritur. idern placet

maternal ancestors hy any title whatever: Theodosius 11 added lucra
nuptialia (dos and donatio propter nuptias), and reformed the eules as to
the intestata succession to peculium adventitium and preferring the
child's own issue to the pater, who by Leo and Anthemius was postponed
also to brothers and sisters. Justinian, as he says in § 1, included under
peculium adventitium (which in the text is called ‘res quae adquisitionem
effugiunt') all that the child acquired otherwise than ex re patris or-in the
way of peculium castrense or quasicastrense: under his legislation con·
sequently achild might have rights over property of three kinds, over one
ol which he had the absolute control ; one over which his pater had a
usufruct, while he was its dominus; and lastly peculium profectitium,
property ol the pater which the latter could resume at will, and oi which
he himself had only the use and enjoyment. lf he were emancipated,
the father originally was entitled absolutely to half the peculium ad-
ventitium, ‘quasi pro pretio emancipationis :² the change which Justinian
made in this matter is mentioned in § 2.
