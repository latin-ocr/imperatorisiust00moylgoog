quasi ex eo filio, quem habet iam adoptatum, vel quasi ex
illo, quem naturalem in sua potestate habet: in eo casu et
lilius consentire debet, ne ei invito suus heres adgnascatur.

sed ex contrario si avus ex lilio nepotem dat in adoptionem,
nou est necesse lilium consentire. In plurimis autem causis8

5. 19, Ulpian, reg. 8. 53 then it was permitted in special cases, apparently
by imperial favour (Gaius i. 102), and eventually an epistola of Antoninus
Pius (Gaius ib.) allowed it generally, though only after inquiry held, and
under conditione : thus all the pupil's guardians had to sanction the act,
Cod. 5. 59. 5, and, as is mentioned in the text, the adrogatur had to give
security for restoration of adrogatus’ property to his next heirs (legitimi
or pupillariter substituti) if he died below puberty 3 this limit being fixed
because at that date the pupillary substitutione became void, and the
child, if he had not been adrogated, would have been able to make
a will for himself. Tbe tabularius to whom security was given was a
servus publicus, Dig. 1. 7 18, Cod. 8. 48. 2: cf. Gothofredus ad Cod.
Theod. 8. 2. 1, and eoa to. 69. 3. The fourth part of the adrogator’s
property, to which adrogatus became entitled under the circumstances
mentioned in the text, was called quarta Antonina or quarta divi Pii, and
the right to claim it seems to have been extinguished by the attainment
of berty.

ἃ. The principle adoptio naturam imitatur, at least in this applica-
tion, was of comparatively late growth, for Gaius says (i. 106) ‘sed et illa
quaestio, an minor natu maiorem natu adoptare possit, utriusque adop·
tionis commune est? Cicero (pro domo 13. 14) accuses Clodius of
having been adrogated by a person younger than himself, though in c. 13
he says it was done with the approval of the pontifices: cf. Suetonius,
Tib. 2. The doubt was settled by the time of Modestinus, who says that in
either form of adoption the adoptans must be older by at least eighteen
years, Dig. 1. 7. 4ο. 1. For the definition of this age as plena pubertas
cf. Paul sent. rec. 3. 4. 2, Dig. 40. 2. 13: 35. 1. 101. 2. .
