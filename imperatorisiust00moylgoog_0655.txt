The simplest mode oi executing a judgment for a liquidated suu
would seem to be to seiae, by state agency, a sufficient amount of the
debtor's property, and from the proceeds of its sale to satisiy the
creditor's claim; should his property be insufficient, to make bima
banlrmpt. Putting aside the exceptional application os pignoris expio
in the legis actio period, this distinction between execution for debt
and execution in banlrruptcy was not recognised by the Romans
until the Empire. ll a man would not satissy a judgment which had
been recovered against him, there was no alternative but to proceed
as in a case ol genuine insolvency. For a very long while indeed
the Romans did not even allow at all that direct and immediate
execution upon a debtor’s property which seems the natural and
reasonable mode ol satislying a creditor's claims: with true legal
‚ conservatism they clung closely to the conception of an obligatior
as apersonal right, a right which availed only against the debtor‘s
person, and not against property ol any kind: for immediately it con·
ferred any right against the property, it ceased, pro lanto, to be an
obligation. It is the person, they said, who is obligatus, and it is
the person to whom the creditor must look to be paid; there is no
execution except personal execution, and it is for the debtor to say
whether he will save himself by sacrificing his property ¹.

The earliest execution procedure is that of manus iniectio as regu·
lated by the Twelve Tables, which is described at length by MnPoste
in his note on Gaius iii. 77. As has already been observed, its seve·
n'ty was mitigated by a lex Poetelia, and, though abolisbed as a legis
actio by the lex Aebutia, it was retained in its milder lorm by the
praetor under the formulary system, during which the damnatus in an
actio iudicati, il the debt remained unpaid lor thirty days, was brought
before the magistrate, and unless he discharged it at once, or gave
security ‘iudicatum solvi’ through a vindex who undertook his delente,
he was ‘addictus' to the creditor, and remained ina condition oi quasi·
servitude until by his own labour or the intervention ol ln'ends the
debt wa's extinguished.

As distinct from this personal execution, execution against the

‚property was first employed only in the case ol debts owed to the
state. Ila man were condemned upon a criminal charge to a pecu·

isdenied by Savigny, see note on Bk. iii. ιι supr.
