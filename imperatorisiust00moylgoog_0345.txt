330 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK III.

mere cognatas, in relation to her, to that oi sui heredes, thus giving

them a statutory right oi succeeding her to the exclusion oi her
agnatos.

The intestate succession to sreedmen is dealt with in Title 7, the
earlier paragraphs os which give a historical summary of the old
rules in cases os both testacy and intestacy, and ol the changes intro-

duced in the interest os the patron by the Praetor and the lex Papia
Poppaea Between this, and a brief account oi the curiously con·
trasted mode oi succession to Latini Iuniani, a class oi lreedmen
which as we know was abolished by Justinian, is a statement oi his
own settlemeut of the classes entitled to succeed upon the intestacy
ol a civis libertus, and oi the latter's testamentary rights against the
patron. The modification which might conceivably he effected in
these rules by the exercise oi a power, conierred by a senatusconsult,
oi assigning any particular ireedman to any particular child in one's
power is considered in Title 8.

The Roman law of intestate succession, especially to ingenui, is au
admirable illustration os the heterogeneous mass of mles which may
grow round any subject usually regulated by law where there is a
variety of legislative organa often actuated by diverse motivas, and
little anxiety in the supreme legislatore or in the lawyer class to
reduce them to formal order and unity by some process ol codifi-
cation. Technically, oi course, the rules which, at the date oi the
publication of the Institutes, decided on whom an intestata person's
universitas iuris should devolve, were enacted by Justinian himself ;
historically‚ they originated either in the Twelve Tables, or in the
Edict relating to bonomm possessio, or in the later civil law, which,
either through senatusconsulta or imperial constitutions conferred
at long intervals oi legislation, and in an entirely disconnected
manner, rights of succession upon relatives ol the deceased whom
the earlier law had altogether passed· over. The maiu drist os this

series of changes was the mme throughout; to fill up the voids, ·

and correct the anomalies of the Twelve Tables; to substitute
cognatiora sor agnatmn as the sole title a person could have to
succeed. No department of law called more imperatively sora
comprehensive simplification, such, ior instance, as that which we
have seen Justinian effected in the law oi Usucapion and Prescrlption;
but the changes made in the Corpus Iuris are hesitating and tentative,
the most considerable perhaps being that in the classes oi bonorum
possessores, necessitated by Justinian's reiorm in the succession to

· hberti, oi which aiull account is given in Title 9. When the Insti-
