THE CODE ΛΝΒ DIGEST OF JUSTINIAN. 65

commoditas exigebat '). The separate laws were to be arranged in
chronological order under generic titles, and each, so lar as was pos·
sible, identified by date and the name os the prince to whom it owed
its introduction. The work was completed ip April an. 529, and was
publisbed under the name codex Iustinianeus with lorce ol law from
the roth of that month. The older codices and constitutions were at
the same time deprived ol all validity, and it was even forbidden to
appeal to any leges cited in the juristic writings, is they had been irr-
corporated, even in a modified form, in the new code.

The task ol dealing in a similar manner with th'e writings of the
jurists was not commenced till the end oi the year an. 530, but the in·
tervcning months bad been employed in a preparatory labour which
could not be dispensed with, and the purpose oi which was a rough
seulement os the points in controversy between the prudentes. This
had been done by a series oi fisty constitutions, known as the quin-
quaginta decisiones, which were regarded as a separate compilation:

ἶ ‘Postea vero, quum vetus ius considerandum recepimus, tam quinqua-
ginta decisiones lecimus, quam alias ed commodum propositi operis
pertinentes plurimas constitutiones promulgavimus, quihus maximus

. antiquarum rerum articulus emendatus et coartatus est! Subject to
these, the commission appointed to executa the work, which consisted .-
(besides Tribonian‚ who superintended it throughout) ol sixteen per-
sons, possessed the same powers of omission, alteration, and modifi-

ζ cation as had been exercised hythe compilers of the Code. They were

instructed not to limit themselves to the five leading jurists who
occupy so prominent a position in the ‘law ol Citations,' but to select
whatever was valuable in the works of all the ‘iuris auctores? The
only exception to this was their admission of Arcadius Charisius and

κ Hermogenian‚ both of whom lived after Modestinus and accordingly

, had not possessed the ius respondendi. The total number ol jurists
upon whom they drew lor their materiale was thirty-nine. Justinian

κ had directed that the commission should arrange the result of their
labours in fifty books, which were divided into seven parts in an order
based partly on that of the code, partly on the system oi the edictal

’ books; the second (de iudiciis) the next seven; the third (de rebus

’ sc. creditis) books twelve to nineteen; the fourth (umbilicus) books
twenty to twenty-seven ; the fistlr (de testamentis) books twenty-eight

κ to thirty-six ς the sixth and seventh, the contente os which were very
miscellaneous, contained respectively books thirty-seven to sowy-four,
and iorty-tive to fifty. Each book again was divided into ¹Titles, headed
