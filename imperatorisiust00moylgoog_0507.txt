492 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV.

law, honorariae or praetoriae is their source is the Edict of the magisd
trate, § g. Real praetorian actions are exemplified by the actiones
Publiciana, Seruiana, and hypothecaria, ἐξ 4-7; among those which
are personal are the actiones de pecunia constituta (ξ 9), de peculio
(§ 10), and others which are penal (ξ ra).

iii. Finally, there is a division the origin ol which is to be sought
in the formulary period, and which turns upon the nature ol the pro·
eedure. Actiones arbitrariae (ξ 31) are those by which the plaintill'
obtains delivery or productiori os speeific property and specific per·
lormance of contract. Actions in personam are either stricti iuris
orbonae fidei (ξ 28), a distinction more sully explained elsewhere¹3
the latter class is illustrated by examples, and the extension of one of
its leading features-set off--to the formeris noticed in § 30.

Lastly, thrust into this classification of actions, in delerence to
Gaius, are one or two topics which would have been better discussed
in some other place. The thirty-second section, which corres-
ponds with Gaius iv. 52, should properly form part of Title 17 (‘de
officio iudicis'); and the explanation of the ellects ol plus and minus
petitio, and ol erroneous as distinct from over claim (ἕξ 33-35, cor·
responding with Gaius iv. 53-60), which really is a matter oi Proce-
dure, might be placed in several ol the following Titles as appropri-
atcly as here.

In the seventh Title are explained the so called ‘actiones adiectitiae
qualitatis,' by which the Praetor had tempered the ine'quitable doctrine
ol the civil law that a master or paterfamilias, though entitled to all
benefit under the contracts ol his slaves or children in power, could
in no case be sued upon thern. By the actiones quod iussu, exer-
citoria, and institoria the superior became liable in solidum whenever
it could be shown that he had directed or authoriaed the contract.
Where a slave or filiusfamilias embarlred a peculium in trade with his
master's or father’s knowledge, and became insolvent, the master or
father was permitted to distribute the assets among the creditors,
though any one of them who was dissatisfied with such distribution
was enabled by the actio tributoria to bring it under judicial review=
is the pater or dominus was himself a creditor, he was entitled to no
larger dividend than the rest Where, on the other hand, the slave
or son made the contract without the superior's knowledge, the latter
was liable in person by the actio de in rem verso solatas the trans-
action had resulted in a benefit to himself ; otherwise he could be
compelled only to surrender the peculium, and had the privilege oi
