PREFACE.

THE text which 1 have followed is that published by
Krueger in his and Mommsen’s Edition of the Corpus iuris
civilis (Berlin, 1877). In writing the Introductions, Commen-
tary, and Excursus‚ 1 believe 1 have consulted the best and

most recent authorities: perhaps my obligation throughout is .

heaviest to Puchta (on whose masterly Institutionen, Book II,
the General Introduction is mainly based),- Schrader, Baton,
and Vangerow· My constant difficulty, in explaining the
text, has been to know where to draw the line between notes,
in the ordinary sense of the word, and a more systematic
treatment ol legal topics. Il 1 seem to have been too prolix,
my excuse must be the scarcity os accessible books upon the
subject in our own language. A French or German edition
of the Institutes might well have been lar shorter, but there
the reader can be referred to systematic institutional treatises
upon points which hardly occur in our text. A book such as

Puchta’s or Kuntze's still remains to be written in English.
Ihave to express my thanks to Professor Bryce, Μ.Ρ., the
present holder oi theChair ol Civil Law in this University, sor
constant encouragement and much actual assistance in my
work. Some ol it he has revised with great care, and he

has benefited the whole by many valuable suggestions and
criticisms.
