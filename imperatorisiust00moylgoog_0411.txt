lludiciales sunt dumtaxat, quae a mero iudicis officio pro-
ficiscuntur: veluti de dolo cautio vel de persequendo servo

edictione veniunt. Conventionales sunt, quae ex conventione
utriusque partis concipiuntur, hoe est neque iussu iudicis
neque 'iussu praetoris, sed ex conventione contrahentium.
quarum totidem genera sunt, quot paene dixerim rerum

ξ 1. Tire de dolo cautio seems to have chiefly, il not solely, occurred in
cases where bona fide possessore were sued by the owner: ‘si post
acceptum iudicium possessor usu hominem cepit, debet eum tradere
eoque nomine de dolo cavere: periculum est enim ne eum vel pigner-
averit vel manumiserit’ Dig. 6. 1. 18, ib. 45: its purpose apparently was to
secure the plaintiss against loss arising from possible misdealing with the
property in the past, or even in the future, besore it carne into his hands.
The cautio de persequendo, etc. was employed where a man got posses·
sion ol another³s slave, who then ran away, Dig. 4. 2. ¹4· ιι, οι where a
slave bequeathed by a testator was enabled to decamp hythe sault of the
heres, Dig. 30. ι. 47. 2.

b 2. There is a reference in Gaius iv. 31 to an obsolete procedure on
damnum iniectum, which had been superseded by the praetor’s provision,
by which any one who apprehended damage to land or a house from the
defective condition os another house or piece oi land could require certain
others, having rights over the latter, to enter into the cautio damni inlecti,
ie. an express promise to make compensation sor any such damage which
actually occurred: the terms ol the Edict are given in Dig. 39. 2. 7. pr.
The right belonged not only to the owner ol the threatened tenement, but
also to persons having other real rights over it, or even detention in vir·
tue ol an obligation, Dig. 39. 2. 13, ib. 38. pr, but not to a bona fide pos·
sessor, Dig. ib. ιι, ib. 13. 9: the cautio could be exacted from the owner,
bonafide possessor (ib. 13. pn), and others having iura in alieno solo, but
it would not be granted if the person threatened already had a remedy in
virtue of some relation actually existing between him and the other (e. g.
lessee and lessor, Dig. ib. 32, ib. 13- 6); and it was not perpetual, but
remained in force only sor the period prescribed by the magistrate, Dig.
ib. 4. pr. ll not entered into within the time fixed at the hearing, the
other party could claim to be put in possession os the dangerous tene·
ment by a magisterial deorse, in order to examine into its condition and
take measures ol precaution, though without power to exclude his oppo-
nent: and ir, aiter the lapse of another interval, the latter had not given
the required promise, his right passed by asecond decree to the complain-
ant, or, il inalienable‚ was extinguished.
