2 INTRODUCTION.

Finally‚ the leglslative work of Justinian will be described with tolerable
fullness, concluding. in particular, with an examination of the scope
and system of the Institutes.

Of the form of the earliest Roman law it is possible to speak more
positively than of its matter and contents. The first trace of genuine
legislation is to be found iu the Twelve Tables, which the mythical
founding of the city preceded by more than three hundred years.
During these three centuries, the law by which the Romans were
governed was unwritten; it was pure custom handed down by tradition
from past generations, and doubtless identical in origin with the usages

of the primitive Aryan stoclr. Modern comparative jurisprudence has ¹

established resemblances so striking between the earliest known in-
habitants of Rome, the usages of the primitive Irish, and those of the
Asiatic Aryan peoples which have been most open to observation, that
(while admitting that it was modilied on every side by such agencies
as climate and the circumstances ofa military people ever in arms) we
must allow that the customary law of Rome, from which a new de-
parture was taken at the time of the Twelve TableS, was of very great
antiquity, though conjectures as to its age are no less unprofitable
than idle. How the custom was preserved, and protected from con-
tamination by foreign elements, we know from writers on the early
history of Rome; it was jealously treasured up by the college of Pon-
tifices, who were the first judges in all matters relating to the family
and property, and who thereby acquired the title of ‘ guardians of the
law ;' ‘omnium tamen harum (legum) et interpretandi scientia et ac·
tiones apud collegium pontificum erant, ex quibus constituebatur, quis
quoque anuo praeesset privatis' (Dig. 1. a. a. 6).

The statement that there was nothing in the nature of statute law

¹ until the enactment of the Twelve Tables may seem to be contradicted .

by the existence of the so-called ‘leges regiae,' of which however we
know little that is certain. ‘Leges quasdam etipse (Romulus) curiatas
ad populum tulit. Tulerunt et sequentes reges, quae omnes conscriptae
extant in libro Sexti Papirii, qui fuit illis temporibus. .. Is liber, ut
diximus, appellatur ius civile Papirianum, non quia Papirius de suo
quidquam ibi adiecit, sed quod leges sine ordine latas in unum corn·
posuit' (Pomponius in Dig. r. a. a. a). Trom this it would appear that
Sextus Papirius, wh0, according to Dionysius (iii. 36), was a pontifex,
made a compilation of these leges regiae in the reign of ¹the last of the
kings. Dionysius also tells us that, after the expulsion of the kings,
Papirius re-established those of theru of which Numa was said to be
the author ; and we know a commentary to have been written on his
