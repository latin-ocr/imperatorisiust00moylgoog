NEW MAGISTRACIES-LEGES LICINIAE. 21

with that oi the comitia centuriata, hut only that the tribal assembly
was established in the lorm in which it had existed, and with the
iunctions which it had enjoyed, before the regular constitution had
been suspended by the appointment oi the commission oi codihcation.
One result oi this restoration was that the. patricians now began to
take part in the comitia tributa, which thereby gradually lost its
character as a merely plebeian assembly. Either by the same statute,
or by another carried hythe same consuls, it was provided thatin
iuture no new magistrate should be created irom whose decisione there
should be no appeal (provocatio) to the centuries.·

The measures by which the covetcd ‘exaequatio iuris' was finally
attained require abrici review. The lex Canuleia (⁸:⁰- 445) legiti-
mated connubium between patricians and plebeians, and by uniting
the members oi the two orders by the tie oi blood rapidly paved the
way ior the other enactments which at length welded them into an
united people, with identical interests, and equal one with another in
the eye ol the law. Two years later was introduced the office oi censor,
which immediately became oi large political importance. The duty
oi making out the lists os citizens in their various classes oi course
involved a very considerable power of allecting the individual in his
political rights; thus, lor instance, the censors were privileged to
exclude a man from the senate, to deprive an eques of his horse and
rank, or to remove a plebeian from his tribe, on account oi deiects
not only oi legal qualification but even oi moral character; while as
moribus praefecti they could lower his position in the eye ol his
iellow-citizens by the subscriptio censoria, or mark set against his
name in their official list-the sure indication oi dishonesty or pro-
fligacy. Among the other functione through which they gained their
political influence may be enumerated the administration ol the public
revenues, the sarming oi the customs, and the making oi all contracta
lor public works ’

At the time oi the passing oi the lex Canuleia, the plebeians had ·

striven hard to gain access to the consulship, but their efforts had
been baffled by the patriciana, wh0, however, conceded that a new
magistracy should be established, ‘tribuni militum consulari potestate,'
to relieve the consuls oi some oi their duties, and to this new office
members oi the plebs were to be eligible. At first it seems to have
been frequently held by plebeians, but by degrees the patricians
succeeded in making it almost as exclusively their own as the consul-
’ sbip had ever been, and Livy represents (vi. 37) a tribune oi the plebs
as saying in the year nc. 3⁶9 that no plebeian had attained this
