(5. ln the case here supposed the title conferred by a completed
usucapion is rescinded or cancelled by in integrum restitutio (note on § 33
int), and the plaintiti' establishes his right by an ordinary vindicatio or
Publiciana according to the precise nature olbis interest : the assumption
by some writers ol an independent action (rescissoria or contraria Publi-
cianae) has no foundation. The text speaks only of protection against
an absent person; but the principle was applied equally in favour ol
those whose property, while they were absent rei publicae causa, had
been acquired per usucapionem, Dig. 4. 6. 23. 33 43. 1. r 5. pr.; cl. the
note on in integrum restitutio, § 33 inl. For the old annus utilis Justinian
substituted in all cases a quadriennium continuum, Cod. 2. 53 7. The
references at the end ol the paragraph are to Dig. 4. 6. 1. 1 3 ib. 21. pr.;
ib. 26.8; 17. r. 57: 44. 7. 35. pr.

ξ 6. The iusta causa of the in integrum restitutio in this case is the dolus
ol the alienee, and the creditors' action, as seems clear from the text, is
in rem: though it is difficult to see why alter restitutio there was
any necessity lor a liction: cl. Bk. iii. 10.3 and notes supr. Whether
the action (as Theophilus says) was called Pauliana is disputed: it is
certain that there was a personal action ol the same name, and lying
under similar circumstances. So lar as can be elicited from the
authorities, it seems probable that the creditors had, as against fraudu·
lent alienation by the debtor (including wronglul payment ol one or
some ol them in lull when he was aware of his insolvency) (1) an actio
Pauliana in personam, Dig. 22. 1. 38.4 (2) an interdictum fraudatorium,
Dig. 36. 1. 67. r (3) an actio in lactum available against a bona fide
alienee, Dig. 42· 8. 10. pr. (4) the in integrum restitutio mentioned in
the text, with a view to a real action (Pauliana l). The relation between
these remedies, and the precise purpose sor which they were respectively
employed, are so variously represented by the commentatore that it is
impossible here to go further into the question. For the missio iu
possessionem os creditore upon their debtors’ insolveney see p. 376 supr.
