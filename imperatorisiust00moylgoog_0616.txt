Titio] DE POENA TEMERE LITIGANTIUM. 601

damnum et impensas litis inferre adversario suo cogatur.. Ex 2
quibusdam iudiciis damnati ignominiosi fiunt, veluti furtivi
bonorum raptorum, iniuriarum, de dolo, item tutelae, mandati,
depositi, directis non contrariis actionibus, item pro socio, quae
ab utraque parte directa est et ob id quilibet ex sociis eo
iudicio damnatus ignominia notatur. sed furti quidem aut
vi bonorum raptorum aut iniuriarum aut de dolo non solum
damnati notantur ignominia, sed etiam pacti, et recte; plu·
rimum enirn interest, utrum ex delicto aliquis an ex contractu
debitor sit.

specified had disappeared, and, as is remarked in the text, the iudicia
calumniae and contrarium were also obsolete, though they bad still been
in use in the age of Diocletian, Cod. Hermog. 5. 3. ln lieu of these
precautions the plaintiff had in all cases ‘pro calumnia iurare’ Cod. 2.
59. 2, and the unsuccessful litigant had to pay his adversary's costs:
‘sive autem alterutra parte absente sive utraque praesente lis fuerit
decisa, omnes iudices, qui sub imperio nostro constituti sunt, sciant in
expensarum causa victum victori esse condemnandum, quantum pro
solitis expensis litium iuraverit, non ignorantes quod si hoc praeter-
miserint, ipsi de proprio huiusmodi poenae subiacebunt et reddere eam
parti laesae coartabuntur' Cod. 3. 1. ι 3. 6.

§2 For the meaning of existimatio see on Ble i. 16. 5 supr. As a
matter of fact, minutio existimationis, which was generically denoted by
the term ignominia, most usually resulted from a citizen’s getting into
a position in which the Edict branded him with infamia, Dig. 3. 2. 1.
Infamia attached, in consequence of a judicial sentence or something
equivalent (infamia iuris) to all persons condemned in a iudicium pub·
licum (Dig. 48. 1. 7), or in any of the civil actions specified in the text
(to which must be added the delictual action for sepulcri violatio, and,
for the older law, the actio fiduciae, Gaius iv. 182), or found guilty of
usury‚ Cod. 2. 12. 20, or ignominiously discharged from military service
(Dig. 3. 2. t), guardians removed as suspecti ob dolum, Bk. 1. 26. 6 supr,
and bankrupts (p. 377 supa). Other persons became infames apart
from anything in the nature of a judicial sentence (infamia immediata),
eg. wives taken in adulter-y, Dig. 23. 2. 43. 12 and 13; guardians who
married their female wards while under age, ib. 66. pr.; and persons
who violated a transactio (p. 387 supr.) made under nath, Cod. 2.
4· 4¹·

Under the Republic the consequence of infamia had been serious 3 the
infamis lost the political rights of civitas, suffragium, and honores3 was
disabled from applying for the magistrate's judicial assistance except on
behalf of himself and specified other persons (‘ postulare: postulare
autem est, desiderium suum vel amici sui in iure apud eum, qui iuris·
dictioni praeest, exponere vel alterius desiderio contradicere' Dig. 3. 1. 1.
