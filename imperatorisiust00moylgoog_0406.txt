bitur. Sub condicione stipulatio lit, cum in aliquem casum4
differtur obligatio, ut, si aliquid lactum luerit aut non luerit,
stipulatio committatur, veluti ‘si Titius consul lactus fuerit,

Capitolium non ascender0, dare spondes?' perinde erit, ac

annuity os 100 aurei sor five years, 500 might be promised in five equal
shares ex die; or instead ol promising 100 per annum lor a person's
lifetime, a number os separate promises of 100 might be made ex die,
each under the suspensive condition of the promisee’s living to such
or such a birthday. ’

§ 4. We have seen (5 2 supr.) that an immediate, though not necessarily
a civil, obligation arose from a promise ex die ; e. g. Kalendis Martiis dare
spondes? A promise made subject to a suspensive condition-e. g. si
Titius consul suerit factus-might at first sight seem to have no legal
effect at all : ‘ante condicionem non recte agi, cum nihil ad interim de·
beatur' Dig.2o.1. 13. 5. Yet this is clearly not so in iact3 t'or (1) it is
said in the text that the promisee’s hope ol the condition being sulfilled,
and of the debt so springing into actual existence, passes to his heres;
if the conditional promise had no effect until condicio existit there could
be nothing to pass to the heir at all, cl. Tit. 19. 2 5 inf. It was otherwise
with legacies‚ on account os their strictly personal nature: unless the
condition were lulfilled before the legatee's decease the latter’s heir was
not benefited, Dig. 36. 2. 5. pr. and 2, Cod. 6. 51. 7 ; cs. note on Bk. ii.
20. 2ο supr. (2) The person who will be bound to an act or forbearance
on the fullilment of the condition is unable by any act os his own to
escape his possible liability in the future: pro tanto he is bound already.
This may be illustrated by Dig. 17. 2. 27 ‘si (socius) sub condicione
promiserat et distracta societate condicio extitit, ex communi solvendum
est,’ Dig. 45.1. 78. pr. ‘si filiusfamilias sub condicione stipulatus eman-
cipatus fuerit, deinde extiterit condicio, patri actio competit ;’ cf. Dig. 20.
1. 13 5 ; 45. 3. 26. (3) Even more direct is Dig. 44. 7. 42· pr. ‘is‚ cui sub
condicione legatum est, pendente condicione non est creditor, sed tunc
cum extiterit condicio, quamvis eum, qui stipulatus est sub condicione,
placet etiam pendente condicione creditorem essa’ Dig. 12. 6. 16, however,
shows that the language here is unguarded, and that until the condition
is tulfilled there was no real obligatio, even naturalis, ior if payment were
made pendente condicione the money could be recovered by condictio
indebiti: cf. Dig. ib. 183 ib. 443 ib. 56. Thus the legal position os a
promisee sub condicione is difficult to describe ; there is as yet no obli·
gation, and yet he is not absolutely without right3 the effect ol the
promise until the condition is fulfitted is only, as Fitting calls it, ‘pre-
liminary' (Vonm‘rkung).
