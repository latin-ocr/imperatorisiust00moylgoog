DE EXCUSATIONIBUS.

Excusantur autem tutores vel curatores variis ex causis:
plerumque autem propter liberos, sivein potestate sint sive
emancipati. si enirn tres liberos quis superstites Rornae
habeat vel in Italia quattuor vel in provinciis quinque, a tutela
vel cura possunt excusari exemplo ceterorum munerum: nam
et tutelam et curam placuit publicum munus esse. sed
adoptivi liberi non prosunt, in adoptionem autern dati naturali
patri prosunt. item nepotes ex filio prosunt, ut in locum
patris succedant, ex filia non prosunt. filii autem superstites
tantum ad tutelae vel curae muneris excusationem prosunt,
defuncti non prosunt. sed si in bello amissi sunt, quaesitum
est, an prosint. et constat eos solos prodesse qui in acie
amittuntur: hi enirn, quia pro re publica ceciderunt, in

or cura were secured against loss from the dishonesty or negligence of
their tutors or curatore. They were also protected (ι) by the possibility
of remotio, Tit. 26 inf. (ο) By statutory restrictions on the tut01³s or
curator’s powers, especially in respect of alienation: see on Tit. 13.1
supr. (3) By a statutory hypothes over the tutor’s or curatoffs whole
property, which had certainly been established as early as the time of
Constantine, Cod. 5. 37. 20. (4) By responsibility of other persons for
the tutor or curator (in addition to his sureties and the appointing magis-
trate). These were the affirmatores, who had at the inquisitio borne
witness to the character of the person appointed, and the nominatores,
persons who proposed or suggested a tutor or curator in any particular
case; this might happen (a) at the petitio tutoris. lfa pupil had no
tutor, anyone could apply for or suggest one, and some pemeus were
bound to do this: eg. the mother (Bk. iii. 56 inf), and other heirs
presumptive ab intestato, under penalty, in default‚ of forfeiting their
n'ghts of succession if the pupil died impubes, Dig. 26. 6. 2. 2: also the
libertus, under a pecuniary penalty, Dig. 16. 2. 1. (b) ln cases where a
man was appointed tutor or curator by a magistrate, he could usually
procure exemption by suggesting some one better qualified (potioris
nominatio) by reason of relationship. This right of nominatio was in
many cases restricted (fragm. Vat. 158, Paul. rec. sent. 2. 29 ‘qui
potiores nominare non possunt ’), and was altogether abolished by Jus-
tinian.

'rin XXV. For the Eastern Empire Romae means Constantinople,
and Italia Thrace, schol. Theoph. By ‘ut in patris locum succedant’
is meant that any number of grandchildren by one dead son count only
as one: ὅσοι δ’ ἂν ὦσιν ἔγγονοι ἐξ iubs uiuri, ἀντὶ ἑνὸς τέκνον ἀριθμοῦνται, Dig.
