IUS CIVILE ΛΝΒ GENTIUM-CUSTOM-AEQUITAS. 27

allies had been incorporated with the Roman people, the limited
· rights denoted by Latinitas were retained as a kind oi reward which
could be bestowed on cities or districts outside Italy which had de·
served well of Rome, hut on which she hesitated to confer the civitas ;
it was thus quite clear what was meant by a ‘Latin ;' it was no longer
an ethnical or geographical‚ but a legal term, and by Latinitas or ius
Latii was understood a limited citizenship, which in certain ways
might be eonverted into full citizenship oi Rome. The lex lunia
Norbana (nn. 19) enacted that slaves who had received their liberty
in some other way than by one os the three civil modes os manu-
mission (vindicta, census, testamentum), and who had hitherto re·
mained legally slaves, though protected in the enjoyment oi liberty
hythe praetor, should possess this ius Latii, whence they were called
latim Iuniani; but the lex expressly prohibited them from making a
will (Ulp. Reg. ao. 14, Gaius i. aa sqq.)¹.

The character ol the substantive law in the period intervening be·
tween the final constitution ol the state and the fall ol the Republic
is a subject important because it involves a discussion oi the origin
and nature of the praetor's indirect power ol legishtion, and oi the
kindred distinction between ius civile and ius gentium. Ius civile is
one ol the two contrasted terms in two celebrated oppositione of
Roman law, between which there is an intimate relation. It is op·
posed, firstly, to ius gentium or naturale in general, and in this con-
nection it is said (Dig. 41. 1. 1. pr.) to be ‘ius proprium civitatis
nostrae 3' so too private law is described (lnst. i. 1. 4) as tripertitum,
‘collectum est enim ex naturalibus praeceptis, aut gentium, aut
civilibus! Secondly, it is opposed to the praetorian law which was
based on and drawn from the ius gentium: ‘ius civile est, quod ex
legibus, plebiscitis, senatus consultis, decretis Principum, auctoritate
prudentium venit: ius praetorium est, quod Praetores introduxerunt
adiuvandi, vel supplendi, vel corrigendi iuris civilis gratia' (Dig. r.
r. 7)². The proper meaning oi ius civile is thus the peculiar in·

¹ Thus in the time oi the classical jurists there were two kinds of Latins: (1)
the Latinitas os the latini coloniarii, which was still to be found in some cities
on which the ius Latii had been conferred, and which contained the commercium
without any limitattom (a) Latinitas acquired by manumission, oi which there were
four varieties: (a)1atins who were such under the lex Iunia Norbana, (b) slaves
manumittet under the age oi thirty years without observance oi the provisions os the
lex Aelia Sentis (Gaius i. 18-21), (c) slaves manumitted by a ‘honitary' owner, or
by a true owner, while they were the subjects ol a usufruct or pledge. (d) the
desnendsnts oi libertini whose Latinitas had been due immediately to manumission.
