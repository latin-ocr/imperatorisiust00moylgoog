eTHE PRAETORS ΛΝΒ THEIR EDICTS. 33

01 the ius gentium, partly 01 the indigenous 10001 the provincial
population; though, on the analogy 01 the edict 01 the praetor
urbanus, the latter would have been excluded. Mr. Long¹ says,
however, that they were founded on the edictum urbanum, though
they likewise comprehended rules applicable only to the admini-
stration of justice in the provinces. They are olten mentioned by
Cicero, who says (e. g. in his letters to Atticus vi. ι) that he pro-
mulgated 10 his province two edicta, one provinciale, which, among
other matters, contained everything that related to the publicani, and
another, to which he gives no name, relating to matters 01 which he
says, ‘ex edicto et postulari et fieri solent! As to all the rest he made
no edict, but declared that he would lrame all his decreta on the edicta
urbana. The provincial edicts may thus perhaps be regarded asin some
way serving the purposes which. lor the generalisations 01 modern soclal
science, are obtained by collections 01 statistics in various parts 01 the
world. The edict 01 the praetor peregrinus was a collection 01 legal
mles which were found to be observed in common by all the peoples
with whom Rome was acquainted3 and the lonnulation 01 such rules
would be facilitated, and their number largely increased, bya com·
parison 01 the various provincial edicte. The institution 01 the pro·
vinces, and, with them, 01 the edictum provinciale, must have given a ’
great impulse to the development 01 the edict 01 the praetor pere·

grinns3 through the medium 01 the latter they were brought into ⁷

relation with the edictum urbanum. We do not know whether the
work 01 Ofilius, referred to by Pomponius 10 Dig. 1. a. a, was an
attempt to collect and arrange the various edicta; but we shall see
that when the edict was systematlsed by Salvius Julianus, in the reign
01 Hadrian, he probably incorporated 10 11 some portion 01 the pro·
vineial legislation (see p. 43 101).

The activity 01 the praetor urbanus in this mode 01 indirect legisla-
tion was due, to avery large extent, to the lex Aebutia, which had cast
upon him the task 01 devisiug and elaborating a new code 01 procedure,
and thereby enormously increased his power 01 altering and extending
the substantive law. Eut it was also due in no small degree to the
exclusiveness 01 the Roman legal system, and to the consequent ne-
cessity 01 discovering some rules, other than the rules 01 the ius civile,
by which the commercial relations between Romans and peregrini
