498 INSTIT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. lv.

1 Furtum est contrectatio rei lraudulosa vel ipsius rei vel
etiam usus eius possessionisve, quod lege naturali prohibitum

in lurtum, but in rapina and damnum iniuria datum both penalty and
compensation are recovered by a single action, which for that reason is
called mixta; i. e. it is ‘tam rei quam poenae persequendae comparata'
Tit. 6. 19 inl.

Gaius’ remark (iii. 182) that all delicts areos one kind, which Justinian
here explains by stying that they all ‘ex re nascuntur,’ means that in
them the obligation is not produced (as in contracte) by different causae;
it springs from the wrongsul act itsell, and from that alone. The use of
the word ‘res’ (sor which cs. the line cited from Terence p. 451 supr.) is
unhappy‚ because it suggests a reference, as probably Justinian intended,
to the obligations quae re contrahuntur, Bk. iii. 14 supr. ; in the Digest
the idea is better expressed by ‘sactum :’ ‘ex sacto actio est, quotiens ex

, eo teneri quis incipit quod ipse admisit, veluti lurtum vel iniuriam com-
misit vel damnum dedit’ Dig. 44 7. 25 ; ib. 52. 8. ln 52. pr. oi the same
Title factum in this sense is opposed to res as a generating cause of
obligations ex contractu.

Os the lour delicts here mentioned furtum and iniuria are older than
the others, both being treated in the Twelve Tables, Gaius iil. 189, Tit. 4
7inl. Damnum iniuria datum was constituted a specilic delict hythe
lex Aquilia, circ. 285 B.C., and rapina or robbery by the praetore edict,
ac 77.

§L This definition requires expansion in two particulare. To rei

should be added mobilis (see Bk. ii. 6. 7 supr.) ε and the motive must be
gain ; apoint marked in the counterpart ol the definition given in Dig.
47. 2. 1. 3 (lucri faciendi causa): cs. Dig. ib. 43. 4; ib. 65. Its terms

require some elucidation. contrectatio implies that without an ‘oven
act’ there can be no lurtum: cf. §bium and Dig. 47. 2. 52. ¹9 ‘neque
verbo neque scriptura quis lurtum lacit, hoc enim iure utimur, ut lurtum
sine contrectatione non liat ;’ but the nature ol this overt act may be
manit'old‚ as will appear below. Fraudulosa implies unlawlul intention ;
intention, because furtum ex affectu consistit, ἕξ 7and 18 inl.; and unlawlnl
intention, because il the person acting honestly believes that his act will
nothe objected to by the person wronged‚ it is not thest: ‘si pennis-
surum credant, extra crimen videri’ ξ 7 inl, though whether in cases such
as that ol which Justinian is immediately speaking unlawlul intention
would not be a presumption iuris et de iure is a question. The animus
lucri faciendi lails, is the wrong-doers intention is merely to cause a
damage to the other ; e. g. il he takes property intending immediately to
throw it into the sea, Dig. 19. 5.14.2; but the requirement ol its pre·
sence is satisfied is the intention is not to aggrandize onesels pecuniarily,
but to benefit onesels in some other way-e. g. where one steals a ring in
order to make a present oi it: ‘narn species lucri est ex alieno largiri et
beneficii debitorem sibi'adquirere' Dig. 47. 2. 54. 1. The division into
lurtum rei ipsius-usus-possessionisve is not designed to distinguish
