suerit post mortem avi, mortuo patre suo desertoque postea

avi testamento suus heres avo non existit, quia nullo iure

cognationis patrem sui patris tetigit. sic nec ille cst inter

liberos avo, quem filius emancipatus adoptaverat. hi autem

cum non sunt quantum ad hereditatem liberi, neque bonorum

possessionem petere possunt quasi proximi cognati. haec de
‘ suis heredibus.

9 Emancipati autem liberi iure civili nihil iuris habent: neque
enim sui heredes sunt, quia in potestate esse desierunt pa-
rentis, neque alio ullo iure per legem duodecim tabularum
vocantur. sed praetor naturali aequitate motus dat eis
bonorum possessionem unde liberi, perinde ac si in potestate
parentis mortis tempore fuissent, sive soli sint sive cum suis
heredibus concurrant. itaque duobus liberis extantibus,
emancipato et qui mortis tempore in potestate suerit, sane
quidem is qui in potestate fuerit solus iure civili heres est,
id est solus suus heres est: sed cum emancipatus beneficio
praetoris in partem admittitur, evenit, ut suus heres pro parte

§a The old civil law os intestate succession regarded agnatic relation-
ship exclusively: those only who were in the agnatic samily osa deceased
person could succeed him. Thus those whom natural reason and more
refined law deem nearer relations were osten excluded by persons to
whom later they would have been preferred : sons or daughters might be
postponed to a distant cousin, because by being emancipated or given in
adoption they had been eapite deminuti, and so ceased to be agnatio
kindred ot' their own father. Tbese anomaliae, as they seem to us, were
but gradually corrected. Arranging the persons who possessed rights of
intestate succession to a deceased in classes according to priority, so that
the first excludes the second, the second the third, and so on, the first class
under the old law, as we have seen, consisted oi the sui. It was enlarged
hythe action os the praetor, whose mode oi intervention has already been
alluded to on Blc ii. 10. 2 supr. He could not affect the hereditas, which
was altogether beyond his control: but he could promise the bonorum
possessio to whomsoever he pleased: and hy promising it, in the first
instance, to liberi of the deceased, he practically added persons to the
class os sui who by the civil law had no claim whatever. ‘Liberi ³ are
those descendants oi a deceased man who either are, or would be, sui,
had they not been either emancipated or given in adoption (though in
the latter case they must have been emancipated by the adoptive before
the natural father-'s decease, h ιο int, Gaius ii. 136, 7); thus children
have no claim to succeed their mother as liberi (Tit. 4 ini), nor have a
man’s grandchildren by a daughter. The principle was analogous to
