438 INS T IT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [ttulit.

stantum gratia intercedit mandatum. Tua gratia intervenit
mandatum, veluti si tibi mandet, ut pecunias tuas potius in
emptiones praediorum· colloces, quarn feneres, vel ex diverso
ut feneres potius, quam in emptiones praediorum colloces.
cuius generis mandatum magis consilium est quam mandatum,
et ob id non est obligatorium, quia nemo ex consilio mandati
obligatur, etiamsi non expediat ei cui dabitur, cum liberum .
cuique sit apud se explorare, an expediat consilium. itaque
si otiosam pecuniam dorni te habentem hortatus fuerit aliquis
ut rem aliquam emeres vel cam credas, quamvis non expediet
tibi earn emisse vel credidisse, non tamen. tibi mandati tenetur.
et adeo haec ita sunt, ut quaesitum sit, an mandati teneatur
qui mandavit tibi, ut Titio pecuniam fenerares: sed optinuit
Sabini sententia—r obligatorium esse in hoc casu mandatum,
quia non aliter Titio credidisses, quam si tibi mandatum esset.

rlllud quoque mandatum non est obligatorium, quod contra

very fact that it is mandatum, and not constitutum or fideiussio. Thus,
the mandator is liable even though owing to incapacity in the third party
no principal obligation is establishedbetween the latter and the man·
datarius, Dig.,4.4 13. pr.; he can save himself by revolring the com·
mission so long as it has not yet· been acted on, ξ 9 inf, Dig. 17. 1. 12. 16,
and the commission itself is revoked by the mandator¹s death ; payment
by him does not release the principal debtor‚ Dig. ib. 28, nor did an
action brought by mandatarius against mandator or the third party
release the other, as formerly was the case with sureties by verbal
obligation, note on ξ 2 supr. ; the mandator, even aiter having paid the
mandatarius, can get an assignment of the latter's right of action against
the debtor‚ the debt not being extinguished as it would be in the case of
a fideiussor (see on Tit. 20.4 supr.); and, finally, the mandator himself
has an action against the mandatarius if the latter accepted the com·
mission and then did not properly execute it, Dig. 17. 1. 6. 4

§6. So strongly was it felt, Justlnian says, that a mandatum tua
tantum gratia created no obligation, that people even extended the
doubt to those which were for the benefit of a third person as well as of
yourself: especially as it seems not improbable from Dig. 17. 1. 6. 4
(cited on 3 supr.) that a mandate aliena tanturn gratia was. also originally
held to be void. Sometimes a person incurred a liability to compensate
in caseos loss accruing to the other party even upon a mere consilium ;
e. g. where by special contract he expressly undertook responsibility for
his advice, and where the advice was given with evil intent, for the very
purpose of damaging the other: ‘consilii non fraudulenti nulla obligatio
est: ceterum si dolus et calliditas intercessit, de dolo actio competit’
Dig. 42. 1. 47. pr. : cf. the text, ‘nemo ex consilio mandati tenetur.³ .
