riaed jarists at the time of their appointment had been the live whose
names have been mentioned. And the lorce ol this fact is irresistibly
increased by the words used by Justinian in Cod. r. 17.a.ao with
reference to the publication oi the Digest, where he says that he has
therein made selections from the jurists (legislatores et commentatores)
‘quos et anteriores piissimi principes admittere non sunt indignati!

It would seem then that the true meaning os the disputed passage
is that which has been given to it by other civilians¹ ; namely, that
it was intended to supplya criterion by which the authority of any
and every juristic writer could be tested. Its intention was not to
exclude any authorized jurist, but to remove the difficulty which arose
from the existence and quotation oi works by writers who had re·
ceived no auctoritas or ius respondendi, and to which Justinian bears
witness in Cod. 1. 17. r. 4. The test was to be the ius respondendi,
and the possession of this was to be inlerred from the lact oi one
jurist being cited as an authority by another os undeniable reputation.
The legislator attained his object by selectinga small number os the
most recent and distinguished jurists who had possessed the ius re-
spondendi, and by confirming their authority, and also that oi ali
others whose views they quoted. Some difficulty is occasioned by
the words ‘si tamen eorum libri propter antiquitatis incertum codicum '
collatione,' which seem to mean that even when a jurist is cited by
one ol the five, he is not to be allowed a voice in the decision ol a
case unless his view, as quoted, is proved and confirmed bya com-
parison oi the passage ol the citing jurist with the original work
(codices) oi the author quoted. The enactment would thus prac-
tically secure to all approved writers the weight which they had
hitherto enjoyed, while it would relieve judges ol the weary taslt oi
listening to the opinions ol others ol only second-rate importance;
it excluded only jurists who had never possessed a first-rate reputa-
tion, and in particular those who lived aster Modestinus.

’ Τὴε opening words in the passage transcribed above lrom the ‘law oi Cita-
tions,’ by which the statutory authority which the other iour leading jurists had
always possessed is extended to Gaius, go to show that the latter was not a
‘iuris auctor: and had never been invested with the ‘ius respondendi! This in·
ierence is supported by the sact thar though his writings were so various, they
contained no responsa, though among them wasa 'liber de casibus,' in which he
collected a large number ol illustrative cases. many oi which were imaginem,
while os the real ones none had been authoritatively pronounced upon by himself.¹
