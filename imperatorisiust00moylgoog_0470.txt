but which was unable to injuriously aliast rights acquired under the
previous contract by third persons: ‘[re secuta] non tam hoc agitur, ut a
pristino negotio discedamus·un ut novae obligationes constituantur’
Dig.2. 14 58.

Among the modes ‘quibus obligatio tollitur’ described by Gaius ia
the commencement os an action, litis contestatio, which, isthe action
were a iudicium legitimum, produced a quasi-novative effect, termed by
the commentators novatio necessaria3 the very delivery ol the formula
in the action by the praetorto the iudex extinguished the delendaut’s
debr, and substituted lor it a new obligation‚ viz. the legal liability to be
condemned il the plaintiff proved his case, Gaius lii. 180, 181. lt dif-
lered, however, in its operation lrom novatio proper (novatio voluntaria),
for it left the original obligation subsisting naturaliter, Dig. 12. 6. 60, and,
as a consequence, did not destrny accessory rights, such as guaranties,
hypothecs, ete, Dig. 46. 2. 29. Of this process-consumption, as it is
called, there are still traces 111 the Corpus iuris, bnt the general rule
under Justinian is that litis contestatio no longer extinguishes the cre·
ditor's right, Bk. lv. 13. 10 inl, Cod. 3.1. 13. 2 and 5; 3.1o. 1. pr. It
must indeed have ceased to extinguish it ipso iure with the disappearance
ot' iudicia legitima under Diocletian, nn. 294 ; but now indeed it no
longer enables it to be counteracted ope exceptionis; an obligatio is
destroyed, not by the bringing of au action, but only by its adjudication‚
so that we cease to read of the exceptio rei in iudicium deductae, which
is swallowed up in the exceptio rei iudicatae, Dig. 9. 44. 33 14 5. 4. 5:
see on Bk. iv. 13. 51111. Novatio necessaria is also said by Gaius to be
produced by judgment, sententia, res iudicata; sor its effecta which do
not belong here, see Poste’s Gaius, p. 447.

Among modes ol extinction operating ipso iure, which are not here
noticed by Justinian, are physical impossibility ol performance arising
ex post iacto without delault ol the debtor, Dig. 46. 3. 92 ; ib. 98. 8; ib.
107: cl. note on Tit. ¹9· 1 supr.; and in some cases death os one ot the
parties to the contract, as in societas (Tit. 25. 5 supr.) and mandatum,
(Tit. 26. ro supr.): cf. Gaius 111. 120, Dig. 4 8. 3²· 3, and Bk. iv. 12.
1 inl, which is important sor a large class ol obligations arising ex
delicto. The operation of compensatio <set-oli) is a matter os some
' little difficulty: see on Bk. iv. 6. 30 inl. Confusio (p. 275 supr.) operated
in this way il the deceased's heir was the sole debtor or sole creditor to
the obligation in question, because one of the prime requirements of an
obligatio, two persons, is no longer satisfied, Dig. 46. 3. 95. 2 ; but this
would be exemplified under Justinian only when the heres, being debtor
or creditor ol the deceased, did not make an inventory‚ see p. 277 supr.
Where the heir was one ol two or more correal or solidary debtors or

creditors os the deceased it was otherwise: see Dig. 46. 1. 71. pr. cited
in Excursus Vll. inl.
