quaeritur, an ei pecunia debeatur, sed an iuraverit. Poenales 12
quoque actiones bene multas ex sua iurisdictione introduxit:
veluti adversus eum qui quid ex albo eius corrupisset: et in
eum qui patronum vel parentem in ius vocasset, cum id non
impetrasset: item adversus eum, qui vi exemerit eum quiin
ius vocaretur, cuiusve dolo alius exemerit: et alias innume·
rabiles. Praeiudiciales actiones in rem esse videntur, quales 13

sunt, per quas quaeritur, an aliquis liber vel an libertus sit,
vel de partu agnoscendo. exquibus fere una illa legitimam
causam habet, per quam quaeritur, an aliquis liber sit:
ceterae ex ipsius praetoris iurisdictione substantiam capiunt.

could not go: ‘non aliud quaeritur quam an iuratum sit' Dig. 12. 2. 5. 2.
The mode in which the oath was used was by the plaintiff demanding os
his adversary in the initial stage ol the proceedings (in iure, in the
formulary period) whether he would swear that the claim had no founda-
tion; if he did so, he was protected by the exceptio iurisiurandi from
further litigation: but ii, without being prepared to go so lar as this, he
challenged the plaintiff to swear to the justice os his claim, and the
latter did so, he was debarred srom deirying his liability; ii he refused
to discharge it, he could be brought to bay by the actio in lactum re-
ferred to in the text.

ᾗ 12. The praetor’s edicte and orders seem, like the leges (Dion. Halic.
R. A. 3. 36), to have been engraved on tablets ol oak‚ which were then
whitened over and exposed to public view. Subsequently other materiale
were used: ‘in alb0, vel in charta, vel in alia materia' Dig. 2. r. 7. pr., ¹
but the name album was retained. Albi corruptio is used in a wide
sense: ‘isqui album raserit, corruperit, sustulerit, mutaverit, quidve
aliud propositum edicendi causa turbaverit, extra ordinem punietur’
Paul. sent. rec. 1. 13a. 3. For the action ol a patron against his freed·
man sor suing him without first obtaining the praetor's permission (Tit. 16.
3 inl.) see Gaius iv. 46, which also refers to the penal actio in sactum
‘contra eum qui vi exemerit eum qui in ius vocatur:’ sor the latter cf.
also Dig. ²·.7· Among the ‘alias innumerabiles’ are the actions men·
tioned in Tit. 5 supr, and ξ 25 inl.

§lta For praejudicial actions under the system of formulae see Ex-
cursus X inl. Their object is merely to judicially ascertain facts which
are ol legal importance, or the existence of alleged legal relations, e. g. a
man's status or patemity, the amount oi a dos (Gaius iv. 44), whether a
woman is married or not, Dig. 25. 3. 3. 4, whether the provisions oi this
or that enactment have been complied with (e. g. the lex Cicereia, Gaius
iii. 123. p. 411 supr), etc. Hence the name praeiudicia: the decision
forms or may sorm the basis ol subsequent litigation. As they do not
result in condemnation, but merely in a pronunciatio, they are sometimes
said to be iudicia, but not actiones (e. g. Dig. 3. 3. 35. 2); Justinian says
