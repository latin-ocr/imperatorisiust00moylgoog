Tit. 6.] DE USUCAPIONIBUS, ET C. 217

est, ut res quidem mobiles per triennium usucapiantur, immo·
biles vero per longi temporis possessionem, id est inter prae·
sentes decennio, inter absentes viginti annis usucapiantur et
his modis non solum in Italia, sed in omni terra, quae nostro
imperio gubernatur, dominium rerum iusta causa possessionis
praecedente adquiratur.

non-owner sells and delivers property, the purchaser, besides this causa
(pro empto) must not know that it belongs to some one other than the
vendor, or that the vendor has no authority to sell ; ‘bonae fidei emptor
esse videtur, qui ignoravit earn rem alienam esse, aut putavit eum, qui
vendidit, ius vendendi habere, puta procuratorem aut tutorem esse’ Dig.
50. 16. 109. By Roman law bona fides was required only at the incep-
tion os possession, and in sales also at the time oi the contract: under
the canon and modern civil law it is different.

(4) The possession must continue uninterruptedly during the period
fixed by law; in case of interruption (usurpatio) the whole time must
commence and run again The time required by the Twelve Tables
was two years for acquisition oi immoveables, one ior that oi moveables.

The exclusion ot' provincial soil from the operation oi usucapio led
indirectly to very considerable changes in the law. The ground upon
which Justinian tells us usucapio was recognised-ne rerum dominia in

y incerto essent—was as real a one in the provinces as in ltaly; and in

them its piace was taken by an analogous praetorian institution, longi
temporis praescriptio or possessio. By this, it a man possessed land sor
ten years (or twenty, is the owner lived out os the province), the latter's
action ior its recovery could, alter the lapse of that period, be defeated
by a plea (called originally praescriptio, later exceptio) alleging the length
oi the defendant’s possession. The rules already stated as to iusta
causa and bona fides, and the positive enactments excluding certain
things from this mode os acquisition, were applied here as wellas
in usucapio; and there is evidence that by this new institution res
mobiles could be acquired (by peregrini) as well as land. lt operated
at first, as it were, as a Statute oi Limitation only, but eventually it
conferred ownership, the longi· temporis possessor being allowed 'to
bring a real action sor the recovery oi the object if deprived of it; see
Cod. 7. 39 8. pr.

When Justinian became emperor, the law oi Prescription in his
dominions consisted- really of two heterogeneous portions. Res mobiles
could be acquired by the old civil law usucapio in a year ; but prac-
tically all the soil os the Eastern Empire was ‘provincial' so that the
old biennii usucapio had no application; its place was supplied by the
praetorian longi temporis possessio oi ten or twenty years. Justinian
resonned the old law as follows: (1) he did away with theold legal dis-
tinction between Italian and provincial soil; (2) altered the periods os
time required, as stated in this section, three years instead of one being
now necessary for the usucapio oi res mobiles3 and (3) upon the
