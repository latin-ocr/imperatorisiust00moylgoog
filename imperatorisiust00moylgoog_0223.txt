stipulationibus id efficere debet. potest etiam in testamento

pactio et stipulatio was the sole mode of contractually creating servi·
tudes of every kind.

There is much difference of opinion as to whether,in addition to the
pactio et stipulatio, a quasi-traditio of the right was required to endow
it with the full proportione of a servitude. Gaius expressly says (ii. 28)
that servitudes, like res incorporales in general, do not admit of traditio ;
but if the latter be conceived as the granting of the physica] control over
a res, or as the permitting it to be enjoyed‚ servitudes will also admit
of this figurative operation, and accordingly many hold that as boni-
tarian ownership at least could always be conveyed by traditio proper,
so pactio et stipulatio required the supplement of this quasi- or figura·
tive traditio to gain full praetorian protection for the right created, as a
‘real’ right. For instance, it is affirmed that this traditio gave a quasi·
possession, entitling the recipient to use the Publician, action, as well as
the actio confessoris ,whereby he was exempted from the onus of proving
his transferor’s title, and which availed also against non· owners of the
praedium serviens it rs quite certain that' m many passages (e g. Dig.
6...·2111,...71257; 7....4tpr‚ 7..;63 8..120)traditioisspecified
as a mode of creating servitudes; but obviously rt must have been pre·
ceded by agreement, and the question is whether a real right could be
created by the latter unsupplemented by the former. There is uo pas·
sage in the authorities which affirms the necessity of traditio, and the
prevailing view now seems to be that it was not essential; though the
contrary is still maintained by some who argue from the jural impossi-
bility of creating real rights by a contract ‘in the proper sense of the
term,' and explain the absence of passages affirming the necessity of
traditio by the consideration thatin the time of the classical jurists
servitudes were, iure civili, not thus created at all.

The other modes in which servitudes in general could originate are :—

(1) Testamentary disposition or legacy; this was commonest in per-
sonal servitudes, especially usufruct, which could either be bequeathed
directly (Tit. 4. 1 ini), or the heir could be directed to create it in favour
of the legatee: ‘ususfructus uniuscuiusque rei legari potest, et aut ipso
iure constituetur aut per heredem praestabitur: ex causa damnationis
per heredem praestabitur, ipso iure per vindicatio χ ’ Paul. sent. rec. 3.
6. 17. Bequest of praedial servitudes, to be du15.dbitudtituted by the heir,
is spoken ofin this section· cf. Dig. 8. 416; 33.3.

(2 2> Deductio; reservation of the servitude m conveying the dominium
either' mter vivos or by will; Tit. 4 t inf, Dig. 82. 34 and 353 8..3
30 and 33.

(3) Judicial decision‚ either (a) by adiudicatro m sibdisium divisoriam,
Blr.' tv. 6. 20, ib 17. rand 5 inf· ,(b) declaring a servitude duly consti-
tuted as against a recalcitrant defendant who refuses to create it him-
self ; or (c) reviving by ‘in integrum restitutio’ a servitude which has
beenlost, Dig. 8. 5. 8. 4

(4) ln certain cases usufruct arose ipso iure in virtue of statutory
'enactment (lex>; e. g. the pater's usufruct in the peculium adventitium
