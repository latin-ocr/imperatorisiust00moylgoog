arbitrio adire hereditatem potest. Servus alienus post domini2
mortem recte heres instituitur, quia et cum hereditariis servis
est testamenti factio: nondum enim adita hereditas personae
vicem sustinet, non heredis futuri„ sed defuncti, curn et eiuS,

Here again there were exceptions on the ground of age and absence
reipublicae causa.

(4) By the same statute, husband and wife who had no children by
the marriage could take under one another’s wills only a tenth of what
was given them (lex decimaria), though the amount was increased by
the existence of issue by a previous marriage, or ir such issue had died.
They were, however, entitled in addition to the usufruct of a third of the
residue from which they were excluded. Portions which under these
last two statutes could not be taken by those for whom they had been
intended, became caduca, and went' in the first instance to co-legatees
with children, in the second, to instituted male heirs with children, in
the third, to male legatees with children, and in delault os all, rothe
treasury. These restrictions, however, no longer existed under Jus-
tinian, the penalties of coelibatus and orbitas having been abolished by
the sons of Constantine, Cod.8.16.r,and the lex decimaria repealed
by Honorius and Theodosius, Cod. 8. 58. 2.

(5) Domitian disqualilied feminae probrosae frorn taking either the
hereditas or legata, Dig. ²9· 1.4r. 1, Cod. 5. r. ²3· For other disabilities
imposed on persons who married a second time, or on illegitimate while
legitimate children were living, see Cod. 5. 9. 6and ro, Nov. 22. 27 and 28,
Nov.8p 12, lor a different case, Tit. 17. 8 ins. Finally, the hereditas
or legata were sometimes ‘erepta’ from the person prima facie entitled
on the ground ol unworthiness (see Dig. 34. 9, Cod, 6. 35), the sorleiture
being sometimes in favour of the fiscus, sometimes in that of other
persons.

For the institution ol servus proprius sine libertate see Gaius ii. 186,
Blr. 1. 6. zsupr, Cod. 6. 27. 5.

§2 Ἡιε opening words of this paragraph are ambiguous3 they may
reler to the institution ol a slave actually at the time belonging toa
hereditas iacens (Dig. 28. 5. 52, ib. 64), or toan institution not to take
effect until the dominus os the slave instituted is dead, Theoph.

The institution of a servus alienus is at first sight enigmatical, foras
he could acquire the inheritance only lor his master, why not institute
the latter at‘ once? The solution is twolold. F irstly, the institution ol
the slave secured the transmission of the inheritance to the heirs of his
master, whereas il the latter had been instituted himself aud had pre-
deceased the testator, the institution would have lapsed: and this could
not be prevented by giving a ‘remainder' to his heirs by substitution, for
they were incertae personae, nemo est heres viventis. To guard against
the contingency of the slave's own death in the liletime ol the testator,
several slaves might be instituted by way of substitution. The other
advantage ol instituting a servus alienus will appear from a considera-
