Tit. rr] DE SATISDATIONIBUS. 57¹

Sed haec hodie aliter observantur. sive enirn quis in rema
actione convenitur sive personali suo nomine, nullam satis·
dationem propter litis aestimationem dare compellitur, sed
pro sua tantum persona, quod iudicio permaneat usquead
terminum litis, vel committitur suae promissioni curn iure-
iurando, quam iuratoriam cautionem vocant, vel nudam pro-
missionem vel satisdationem pro qualitate personae suae dare
compellitur. Sin autem per procuratorem lis vel inferturve13

§2 Thus the engagement entered into in Justinian’s time by a
defendant who appeared in person covered the ground ol both (1) the
old vadimonium or cautio iudicio sisti, Gaius iv. 185, which secured the
appearance ol the defendant in iure in cases ol adjournment‚ and (2) the
clause de re defendenda oi the security iudicatum solvi ; it bound him to
appear in court on the day ol trial and defend the action: but he was no
longer required to guarantee satisfaction of the judgment. The ordinary
mode oi entering into this engagement was satisdatio ; but even before
the time oi Gaius the praetor had drawn distinctions in vadimonia, being
satished in some cases with a merely personal undertaking without
sureties (vadimonium purum), and in others with such undertaking
lortified by the oath or by a summary process sor the recovery of the
recognisance (‘recuperatoribus suppositis' Gaius iv. 185). UnderJustinian
landowners (Dig. 2. 8. 15) and personae illustres (Cod. 12. 1. 17) could be
compelled to bind themselves in iudicio permanere usque ad terminum
litis only by a written cautio iuratoria ; it is not clear who were privileged
to give a bare promise to this effect, though the edict seems to have con·
tained caresul regulations on the subject, Gaius loc. cit: ‘pro tenore
generalium edictornm’ Cod. 12. 22. 8. '

§8. The general principle as to when a procurator who appears as
plaintiti' must give security ratam rem dominum habiturum is iound in
Cod. 2. 13.1 ‘cautio ratihabitionis tunc exigitur a procuratore, quotiens
incertum est anei negotium mandatum est,’ cf. Dig. 3. 4. 6. 3 ‘si de
decreto dubitetur, puto interponendam et de rato cautionem) The
agent was also exempted where his appointment was notified by letter to
the other party, note on Tit. 10. pr. supr, or was evidenced by a libellus
addressed to the emperor, Dig. 46. 8. 21.
