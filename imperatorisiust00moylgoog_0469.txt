or other not enforceable by action. But two obligations are essential;
il there is not one to novate, the attempted novation is null ; if there is
one to novate, but the novating contract is void (e. g. ‘si id quod tu mihi
debeas, a peregrino, cum quo sponsus communio non est, spondes verbo
stipulatus sim' Gaius iii. 179), the former is altogether unaiiected

The promise of a slave ordinarily created a natural obligation, and
consequently, as Servius Sulpicius argued (Gaius, loc. cit), it is hard to
see why it should have no novative eiiect; the explanation given by
Theophilus is ὅτι ποιεῖ νοβατῖωνα οὗ μόνον τὸ τίκτεσθαι φυσικὴν ε’νοχήν, ἀλλὰ
καὶ τὸ ὑπεῖναι πρόσωπον· ἀπρόσωπος δὲ ὁ δοῦλος.

The rule that, if the parties to the new contract are the same, a
novation ensues only if it contains ‘novi quid’ holds only, where the
novated obligation was itself verbal. li it had been otherwise, novation
would have been disabled from discharging one oi its most valued
lunctions, via the substitution of obligations pursued by actions stricti
iuris ior obligations eniorceable only by actio ex fide bona. The Procu-
lians were oi opinion that the adiectio or detractio os a surety in the new
contract was not sufficient to support a novation, Gaius iii. 178.

For condicio and dies see on Tit. 15. 2 and 4 supr.

Servius Sulpicius had held that a conditional stipulation novated an
unconditional contract whether the condition was iulfilled or not Gaius
(iii. 179) thought that the old contract subsisted until the condition of the
new one was fullilled, but suggests that ii the creditor sued upon it before
such fulfilment he might be met by exceptio doli or pacti, and this was
soon recognised as law, Dig. ²3· 3. 503 ib. 83; 12. 1. 36 ; though Labeo
(Dig. 23. 3. 80) had thought otherwise.

Among the praesumptiones or evidence upon which the jurists relied
to prove that there was animus novandi was, according to the Sabinian
school,the addition oiasurety (cf. Dig. 2. 14 30. 1) ; ior the presumptione
against such intention see Dig. 46. 2. 6. pr. and r. ; 45. 1. 58. Justinian's
own enactment is in Cod. 8. 42. 8 ; his statement that, unless the inten-
tion to novate was express (‘ nisi ipsi specialiter remiserint quidem priorem
obligationem et hoc expresserint, quod secundam magis pro anterioribus
elegerint¹ Cod. loc cit), the two obligations should subsist side by side is
apparently subject to the qualification that when one was iulfilled the
other was ipso sacto extinguished; see Dig. 46. a. 8. 5.

§a When the res was no longer integra, an agreement between the
parties to be off their bargain did not merely extinguish the obligation :
it rather operated as a new contract which bound the one in whose
favour performance had taken place to restore the etheria statumque,
