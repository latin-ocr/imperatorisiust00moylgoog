tion and the animus domini. No one possessos who has not the

exclusive physical power ol dealing with an object, coupled with the
intention ol dealing with it as his own against all the world ; the pre·
senec ol these two marks entitles the person in whom they are united
to the protection oi interdicte. This possession, as distinct from
detention, is called in the authorities most frequently possessio simply,
hut sometimes also possessio civilis (e. g. Dig. 41. 2. 243 10. 4. 7. r;
¹45· 1. 3⁸· 7); Savigny terms it ‘possessio ad interdicta;’ we shall
call it unisormly Possession.

In respectos four cases the preceding statement requires aslight
modification. Possession is ascribed in the Digest to the emphyteuta
(aa. 1. 25. ἡ, the pledgee in a pignus (41.3.16), the sequester or
·stakeh01dert16.3. 17), and ordinarily to the precario rogans (43. 26. 4.
1), yet in no case can they be said to have the animus domini, lor they
all recognise and respect the dominium ol another person. ln these
cases, then, sor the animus domini the law allows the substitution ol
an animus alienam possessionem exercendi ; they are termed by
Savigny cases of derivative or representative possession, and are
clearly distinguishable from those oi the agent, borrower, ordinary
bailee, hirer, usufructuary, and the missus in possessiouem (Dig. 41.
a. 3. ²33 ib. ιο.4 1), none ol whom have more than Detention.

Possession is acquired by the productiori ol its tvo elements, via.
corpus or lactum (when this alone is present there is detention) and
animus ; ‘adipiscimur possessionem corpore et animo, neque perse .
ranimo aut per se corpore' Dig. 41. a. 3. r. The act by which corpus,
the physical control, is produced, is called usually apprehensio, or,
where ellected with the consent or cooperation ol the prior holder,
traditio. Apprehensio of immoveables most commonly takes the
form ol actual presence upon the land (Dig. 41. a. 3. r), but actual
entry is not necessary il one stand near enough to overlook it all, sor
here one's·control over it is as great as if one had actually entered
(Dig. 41. a. 18. a). Nor, to ‘apprehend’ moveables, is it strictly
necessary to grasp them with the hand; it is sufficient ii the thing
could at any moment be so actually grasped as to give the exclusive
control (Dig. loc. cit. 1. ar); in both cases itis not the nearness,1nor
even the presence, ol the object which constitutes corpus, but the
capacity olphysical control to the exclusion ol all others ; thus,aman
has not detention oi objects placed in his house, il it is in the occupa·
tion ol another, e. g. alessee.

The animus domini will oi course usually precede, as well as
accompany, apprehension. But sometimes it arises later: e. g. a
