2fluminibusque. Est autem litus maris, quatenus hibernus
fluctus maximus excurrit. Riparum quoque usus publicus

sest iuris gentium, sicut ipsius fluminis: itaque navem ad eas

4'appellere, sunes ex arboribus ibi natis religare, onus aliquid in
his reponere cuilibet liberum est, sicuti per ipsum flumen
navigare. sed proprietas earum illorum est, quorum praediis
haerent: qu'a de causa arbores quoque in isdem natae eorun-

5dem sunt. Litorum quoque usus publicus iuris gentium est,
sicut ipsius maris: et ob id quibuslibet liberum est casam ibi
imponere, in qua se recipiant, sicut retia siccare et ex mare
deducere. proprietas autem eorum potest intellegi nullius esse,
sed eiusdem iuris esse, cuius et mare et quae subiacent mari,

quae in civitatibus sunt, ut theatra stadia et similia et si qua
alia sunt communia civitatium.

§a Res' publicae seem to be divisible into two* classes, (1) Thmgs
which belong to and are used by the state as by a private person: e. g.
public slaves, money, stores, etc: these are not properly errtra patri·
monium nostrum. (2) Things which are publico usui destinatae, (ie.
not communes generally, but only to cives), e. g. roads, harbours, public
rivers (ie. ‘flumina perennia' Dig. 43 12. 3) and their beds. The banks
ol public rivers were private property, subjected by the law to a lrind os
servitude in favour oi all members oi the state, ξ 4 inf.

§a Universitas here seems to be used as equivalent to civitas, i.e. a
Roman city or municipium. Taken in this sense, res universitatis are
analogous to res publicae,- an'd are divisible in the same manner. Such
property only oi a provincial city as is municipum usui destinatum is
extra patrimonium: a res publica isa thing which any civis may use:
a res universitatis is oue which may be used as oi right only by the
members of the universitas.

Taken iu its widest sense, universitas is equivalent to the ‘juristic
person' oi modern writers. For the definition and characteristica os
juristic persons in general reference may be made to Holland's Juris·
prudence p. ²²5 sq.: those recognised by Roman law may be sub-
divided into universitates personarum and universitates bonorum [The
latter should not be confounded with socelled universitates rerum (us-
tantium), such as a flock oi sheep, which have uo independent legal
existence spart from the elements which go to make thern up]

A universitas personarum (or corporation) is an aggregate oi natural
persons forming au ideal whole, regarded by the law as a ‘person ' distinct
from its members ior the time being, because its existence does not
cease along with theirs, and invested with rights and subject to derdes,
other than those oi the individuals, tehen singly, oi vrhich it is oum·
