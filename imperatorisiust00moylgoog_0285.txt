§ 8. Before Justinian the querella lay whenever the claimant had re·
ceived less from the testator than he was entitled to by law: ‘si parum,
quarn ei debebatur, suerit consecutus, movere de inofficioso testamento
querellam concedatur’ N ov. Theod. 1. 22. He, however, enacted (Cod.
3. 28. 30. pr. and ι) that in future the sole ground lor the action should
be that the claimant had received nothing at all: il he bad received
something, though ever so little, his sole remedy was to bring the new
action ad supplendam legitimam against the heir or heirs, which lest the
will untouched: lor precedents ior this rule cf. Paul. sent. rec. 4. 5. 10,
Cod 3. 28. 4. The share which one could demand was one-fourth ol
what one would have had if the testator had died intestate, Dig. 5. 2. 88
Justinian subsequently enacted, by Nov. 1181, that ii a man had less
than five children he must leave them together, in equa] shares, at least
a third oi the inheritance3 ir rive or more, at least one-hali.

t 4. Acceptance oi anything, with full knowledge, under the will was
taken to imply acquiescente in its dispositions, and so barred the
querella, Dig. 5. 2. 8; a rule sometimes so strictly construed that to assist
a claimant under the will as counsel was held to exclude one from im-
peaching it on one's own account, Dig. ib. 32. pr.

§5. ‘Qui testamentum inofficiosum dixit, et non obtinuit, id quod in
testamento accepit, perdere, et id fisco vindicari, quasi indigno ablatum’
Dig. 5. 2. 8. ¹4· For other exceptions see Paul sent. rec 4 5. 9.10,
Dig. 34. 9. 5, B. 5. 2. 22. 1 and 3, ib. 30. r.
