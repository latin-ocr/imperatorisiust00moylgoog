Tit. ²4] DE LOCATIONE ET CONDUCTIONE. 427

(eg. land tax) must be borne by him, Dig. 4 3. ro.3 ; he must execute all
repairs, Dig. 19. 2. 15. 1 ; ib. 25. 2, and compensate the conductor for all
necessary repairs and expenditure incurred therein by him as wellas for
unexhausted improvements, Dig. ib. 19. 4.; ib. 55. Ὶι.

If the locator disabled himself from assuring the conductor the quiet

use aud enjoyment of the res locata (e. g. land) for the whole of the time
agreed upon, as by selling it to a third person before the period for which
it was hired had elapsed‚ he was of course answerable in damages. But
the purchaser could evict the lessee even without notice (Kaus bn'cht
Marta: ‘qui fundum fruendum vel habitationem alicui locavit, si aliqua
ex causa fundum vel aedes vendat, curare debet, ut apud emptorem
quoque eadem pactione et colono frui et inquilino habitare liceat:
alioquin prohibitus is aget cum eo ex conducto’ Dig. 19. 2. 25. r, ‘emp-
torem quidem fundi necesse non est stare colono, cui prior dominus
locavit, nisi ea lege emit’ Cod. 4. 65. 9. 1f not evicted, the conductor
must continue to pay his rent to his lessor. ,
’ The conductor, besides being answerable, as is said in the text, for
exacta diligentia in the care of the res locata, must pay the merces agreed
upon, unless through default of the lessor he cannot use the thing for
the purpose for which it was hired. if any accident occurs to it whereby
its use or productive powers are seriouslyimpaired, he is entitled to have
the merces proportionately abated, Dig. 19. 2. ις. 7. In respect of
agricultural land there were special regulations, the lessee, if he were
prevented from gathering his crops, and so suffered serious loss, by ·
events which we describe as ‘the act of God and the leing’s enemies’
(Dig. 19. 2. 15. 2-4), being entitled to a complete remission of rent for
the year (Dig. ib. 15. 7), and to a proportionate reduction if the disaster
were partial only: ‘ubicunque tamen remissionis ratio habetur ex causis
supra relatis, non id, quod sua interest, conductor consequitur, sed
mercedis exonerationem pro rata ;’ but if his lease was for a term of years
yet unexpired, he must, if possible, make up the amount remitted from
unusually good seasons‚ Dig. ¹9· 2. 15. 4. The conductor was also bound
to re·deliver the res locata at the end of the time for which he had hired
it in as good condition as when it came into his hands, saving ordinary
wear and tear; if he groundlessly refused to do this up to judgment in
an action brought for its recovery Zeno made him liable in duplum, Cod.
4. 65. 34, and he was not exempted from the obligation of restitution
even though he were or professed to be its owner; he must give it up,
and then he may bringa real action to establish his dominium, Cod. ib.
a 5. The relations of locator and conductor were not affected by the fact
of the latters subletting, which created no ‘privity' between locator and
sublessee, though the former had a hypothec over the latters invecta et
illata, which, however, he could evade by paying his rent to the superior
instead of the immediate landlord, Dig. 13. 7. 11. 5.
