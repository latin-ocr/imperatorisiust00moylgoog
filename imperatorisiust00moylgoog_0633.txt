618 EXCURSUS X.

a ‘ guarautor' or ‘insurer' of the right which he has attested—a eon·
ception which we shall be the better able to realize by remembering
the Jiadr’crizl character of the recognitor in the Assizes of Henry 11-;
verum means ‘the assured,' truth that for which one becomes semrity;
the witnesses, who in the legis actio are called upon ‘litem contestari,¹
discharge, upon this theory, some intelligible fonction ¹. Why, we
may ask, could a woman not be a witness to the transactions of the
ius citrile? The answer would seem to be, because she iacks the
physical force of man to which the witness must in the last resort
appeal, if he is really to do his duty as ‘assuren' Why, again, could
many of a man's own relations, whose evidence might incur suspicion
on the ground of interest, attest his solemn acts and dispositionsl
Because cred'br'lr'ty is not, as with us, the essential; the essentialis
rather the strong arrn. Joint responsibility for wrong is familiarto
readers of Greek legend no less than of Anglo-Saxon history; joint
suretyship for right—the idea of inducing awrongdoer to submitto
justice by the moral and physical force by which his adversaty is

backed-is peculiarly Roman. Astrong confirmation of this theory

is found in the will made in the comitia calata; a disposition which

it was desirable should be guaranteed by a larger force than any l

ordinary matter, because it was of far greater importance, affected,

perhaps prejudicially, more interests, and therefore was more likely to ,

be impeached, and exposed to the chanees of stronger opposition: ac-
cordingly, it was witnessed, and so guaranteed, by the whole Roman
populus, and even when in the will made per aes et libram the number
of witnesses was reduced to five, these, according ¹to a very plausible
theory, represented the whole people in its five census-classes. if this
conjecture be true, the form of mancipation was an easy and conve
nient means of throwing round dispositions the aegis of a public
guarantee: violation ofa right acquired per aes et libram is a violarim
of public order: resistance to the person entitled is resistance rothe
State.

iii. The contractual decision of disputes took two fonns. The oue

consisted in the complainant's giving his adversary the option of de· 1

nying his liability on oath, or of being taken, in default, to admit it:
it remained a permanent institution at Rome even to the time ol

Justinian, in whose Digest (38.12. a) we read ‘manifestae turpi· r
tudinis et consessibm's est nolle nec iurare nec iusiurandum referre.¹ l

The other was reference of the matter by common consent to arbi·

tration: from this, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the whole Roman
