The right ol the lull owner to manumit was originally subject tono
restrictions, except so lar as he was bound by any contract or testa·
, mentary disposition under which the slave came into his possession.
subsequently, however, limitations were imposed, in the main on poli-
tical grounds, by the lex Aelia Sentia, Α. 1). 4, § 4 int'. and Tit. 6. pr, and
the lex Fufia Caninia, Tit. 7 int, and by the lex Iulia de adulteriis, Bk.
iv. 18. 4 int, in order to assist the conduct of criminal proceedings.

Until Justinian abolished the distinction between Bonitary and Quiri-
tary ownership (note on Bk. ii. 1. 11 ini.) a slave might belong to one

could manumit him, but only so as to make him a Latinus Iunianus3
Ulpian, reg. 1. 16. Where one person had a usulruct in a slave belong·
ing to another, any attempt by the tormer to manumit him merely resulted
iu the extinction oi his usufruct ; he could be manumitted by the owner,
who, however, could not thus prejudice the right of the usufructuary;
Ulpian, ib. 19: Justinian (Cod. 7. ις. 1) made some alteration in this.
The same principles were observed in respectd oi a slave who had been
given in security by pledge ς but the manumission oi any slave in whom
another person had a ius in re aliena made him Latinus only and not
civis, until Latinitas was abolished by Justinian. r the manumission
oi a slave owned by joint proprietors see Bk. ii. 7. 4 and note ini.
