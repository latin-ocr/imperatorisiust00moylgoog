DE MANDATO.

Mandatum contrahitur quinque modis, sive sua tantum
gratia aliquis tibi mandet, si've sua et tua, sive aliena tantum,
sive sua et aliena, sive tua et aliena. at si tua tantum gratia
tibi mandatum sit, supervacuum est mandatum et ob id nulla

(a) If the partner who actually makes the contract was instructed to
do so by the rest-ie. is their agent-they are each liable insolidum:
‘sed si plures exerceant, unum autem de numero suo magistrum fecerint,
huius nomine in solidum poterunt conveniri ;' nor could they claim the
beneficium divisionis, ‘ne in plures adversarios distringatur quicum uno
contraxerit ;’ one who paid os course had regressus, Dig. 14. 3. 13. 23
ib.14

(b) lf he is not their express agent for the purpose, the actually con-
tracting partner alone incurs liability, ev'en though the transaction is
entered into on behalf of the firm, unless (1) the rest subsequently ratily
it, whereby they become as liable as il it had been authorized by them
from the first, and (2) except and so sar as the firm has been benefited
by the contract: ‘iure societatis per socium aere alieno socius non obli·
gatur, nisi in communem arcam pecuniae versae sunt' Dig. 17. 2. 82.
Thus in Roman law socii have no implied authority to bind one another
even upon transactions which form their ordinary business.

(c) lf he makes the contract in his own name, the rest incur no
liabilities even though it results in a benefit to them.

nit. XXVI. The contract os mandatum produces effects os two dil-
ferent kinds; first, an obligation between the principa] (mandator,
dominus) and the agent (mandatarius, procurat0r3 the lirst temr is not
classical)‚ which is discussed sully in this Title; and second, the relation
of representation; this subject, which regards the rights and duties
that arise immediately for the principal from the contracts made by
his agent on his behalf, is discussed in Excursus lX at the end of
this Book.

The scope os the agent's commission might be general as well as special,
and so might extend to the management ol a person’s entire affairs ; but
it might not be altogether indefinite, Dig. 17. 1. 48. 2, unlawful, or im-
moral, § 7 int, and it must relate only to future acts: ‘si post creditam
pecuniam mandavero creditori credendam, nullum esse mandatum rec·
tissime Papinianus ait' Dig. 17. 1. η. 14.

Justinian’s five species ol mandatum are taken from the res quotidianae
of Gaius (Dig. 17. i. 2. 1-6), where, as here, the possible caseis omitted
os a commission being given by Α to B to lend money to C, in order to “
enable the latter to pay a debt owing to himself, which is in the interest
ol all three (sua, tua, et aliena). Supervacuum is here used to mean
‘void ε’ cf. inutilis in Tit. 19 supr.
