4 INTRODUCTION.

the gens, the gens the family, the family the individual; to belong to

the first a man must also belong to the last member of the series; or ’
rather we should say that primitive law takes little account of indi·
viduals‚ but of groups‚ that is to say, of families or gentes only.

The comitia curiata, and in fact the whole constitution, was based
on this family, gentile, and tribal organisation. The comitia curiata,
which was the popular assembly, was composed of all the patres
familias ‘of the gentes; it was thus a gathering of the heads of familias
arranged on the principle of real or fictitious relationship (Gellius xv.
27 ‘quum ex generibus hominum suffragium feratur, curiata comitia
esse ’). But the services of the great majority of ablebodied citizens
were constantly required by the military exigencies of a state which as
yet drew no distinction between a stranger and an enemy; conse-
quently, to superintend the general conduct of affairs, there wasa
council or senatus consisting, after Tarquinius Priscus, of three hundred
of the patres gentium, 3 hundred from each tribe. The principles of
democracy 3ηά oligarchy were thus both represented, and two ex-
amples may be illustrated to quote the ‘ system of checks and balances’
by which harmony was preserved between them. The nomination of
the king, or supreme executive magistrate, lay with the senate, but re·
quired confirmation by the comitia, which, by a lex curiata (Inst i.
a. 6), invested him with an imperium of life-long duratio'm whereby
he became, externally, the leader of the host in arms, intemally, the de-
positary of the highest administrativa functions of govemment.' On
the other hand, it was to the populus alone, assemblcd in its comitia,
that the legislative fonction belonged, though this function could not
be called into action without the authority of the senate, which alone
possessed the right of submitting subjects for deliberation, 3ηά of·
initiating changes of law; it was the populus which decided upon war
3ηά peace, and which chose the king nominally, and the senators
actually: but in the exercise of all these rights it had to wait for action
to be first taken by the probouleutic body, whose members it chose
itsell, but whose personal constitution, when once selected, it could
modify only in a constitutional manner.

The origin of the other comitia was later in date. So far nothing
has been said to suggest that there were any inhabitants of Roman
territory who were not citizens—either themselves heads of families, or
subject to the potestas of a paterfamilias. From the very first, how-
ever, there seems to have been a number of free persons dwelling
around the three tribes, and yet not belonging to them; abiding on
Roman soil, 3ηά therefore subject to the dominion of Rome, yet pos·
