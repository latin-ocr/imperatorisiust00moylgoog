IUS RESPONDENDI-CONFLICT OF RESPONSA. 51

. bringing it into connection with, and placing it in a subordinate
relation to, the new imperial system. He resolved to make the
fonction ol a jurist, so iar as the class was to possess any authority,
a quasi-public sanction ; and this was effected by conferring on
certain jurists the ius respondendi, whereby their responsa would be
given, as it were, under imperial sanction: ‘et, ut obiter sciamus, ante
tempora Augusti publice respondendi ius non a principibus dabatur,
sed, qui fiduciam studiorum suorum habebant, consulentibus re-
spondebant. Neque responsa utique signata dabant, sed plerumque
judicibus ipsi scribebant, ant testabantur, qui illos consulebant Pri·
mus divus Augustus, ut maior iuris auctoritas haberetur, constituit, ut
ex auctoritate eius responderent, et ex illo tempore peti hoc pro
beneficio caepit. Et ideo optimus princeps Hadrianus, curn ab eo
viri praetorii peterent, ut sibi liceret respondere, rescripsit eis, hnc
non peti, sed praestari solere, et ideo, si quis fiduciam sui haberer,
delectari se, populo ad respondendum se praepararet' (Pomponius in
Dig. r. a. a. 49). A sonu was thus prescribed in which official responsa
should be delivered; they must be written and sealed by their author,
as a precaution against forgery. This practice oi investing certain
selected Jurists with the ius respondendi was followed by Augustus'
successors, and the prerogative was constantlyassuming more and
more the character ola magisterial suncti0n3 thus Gaius (i. 7) defines
the prudentes as those ‘quibus permissum est iura condere,’ and a
later writer speaks ol a jurist being possessed of νομοθετικὴ δύναμιν. It
is not certain what discretiori a iudex had under the older system
aa to accepting or rejecting the opinion oi a prudens whom he
consulted. Now, however, he was obliged to decide in accordante
' with the advice oi any jurist to whom the ius respondendi had been
delegated by the Emperor. Yet among those who were possessed of
this privilege there was no ascertained order of precedencc ; how then
was the matter decided il the two parties to an action submitted
discordant responsa? In such a case we must suppose that the
judge was free to choose whichever ol the two opinions seemed to
him the more satisfactory. But the difficulty became greater asin
course ol time the writings ol the privileged J'urists, the ‘iuris auc·
tores,' accumulated; for these writings were as authoritative as the
responsa, os which in a large degree they consisted (whence Justinian
says (Cod. i. ιγ. 1. 4) ‘Antiquomm prudentium, quibus auctoritatem
conscribendarum interpretandarumque legum sacratissimi principes
praebuerunt'); and it obviously became easier every day for a party
to quote from this or that jurist a view diametrically opposed to the
