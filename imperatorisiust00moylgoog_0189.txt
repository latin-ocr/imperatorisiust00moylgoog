174 excursus r.

an inserence: all that is stated in tlte text is that on a vestal's dying
intestate she had no heir ab intestato, but that her estate escbeated to
the treasury, and the lawyers were puzzled to explain this: ‘id quo
iure fiat quaeritur! Savigny says the explanation is simple: ‘The
reason why a vestal had no intestata heirs was that a woman could
have no suus heres, and that she, in particular, had no agnates to take
in delault, because she had lelt her agnatic family! But il this had
been the true solution, can we believe that the Roman lawyers were
unable to discover it? It would have suggested itsell to the vetiest
tyro; and it is inconceivable that had this been the case Gellius could
have written the words ‘id quo iure fiat quaeritur! A better explana·
tion is perhaps to be lound in the vestal's immediate relation to the
gods: her lile had been devoted to their service, and it was only con·
sistent that, on her dying without disposing ol her property by will, it
should go to the treasury lor sacrificial purposes. The case of the
Flamen Dialis is exactly parallel: see Gaius iii. 114.

The real lact seems to bethar Savigny has been misled by his desire
to establish ‘a harmonious system ol legal conceptions' into adopting
aview against which there is art irresistible weight ol textual authority;
he has been overpowered by the word ‘deminutio’ and hythe analogy
which, according to him, there ought to be between deminutio maxima,
media, and minima. Not to spealt ol tlte impropriety of arguing
from words irt the sace ol the clearest authority to the contrary, it may
be observed that tlte jurists agree in describing the essence ol capitis
deminutio as amere change rather than a deterioration ol condition:
ir is a ‘status mutatio! It is true that in many cases of capitis de-
minutio minima (e. g. osten in adoption) the agnatic rights which were
lost were more thart outbalanced by the rights acquired in the new
lamily; bttt the prominent idea, the feature on which the legal mindis
concentrated, is usually the immediate loss, not the compensatory
gain. Savigny himsell would not deny that there was a capitis derni-
nutio (media) when a Roman citizen lost his civitas, even though he

acquired citizenship in another city whereby he enjoyed lar greater
advantages: and similarly, it is always a 'capitis deminutio (minima)
il a man loses his previous agnatic rights, even though he acquires in
exchange a perhaps better and more advantageous position itt another
family.
