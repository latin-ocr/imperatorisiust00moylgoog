CUSTOMARY LA W-LEGES CURIATAE. 3

compilation towards the end ol the republic by Granius Flaccus, which
is quoted in Dig. 50. 16. 144. It is clear, from the passage cited above
from the Digest, that the jurist Pomponius assumed the identity ol the
work, on which Flaccus based his commentary, with the original ius
civile Papirianum but the truth ol his assumption is much doubted by
later historians. However, even if we allow that the leges regiae were
genuine enactments, introduced, on the motion ol the king, by the
senate into the comitia curiata, and there clothed with the force ol
law, they were probably not more than lormal restatements ol cus-
tomary law already binding. That Papirius, a pontifex, was so familiar
with their contents may possibly be taken to show that they were
merely ol sacerdotal import ; and il in lact his collection ol them sur·
vived to the time ol Granius Flaccus, it is probable that it was used by
the later pontifices only to enlorce religious forms ol observance
through its assumed derivation from the consecrated figures ol the
mythical lcings ol Roman antiquity. Nothing ol these leges has been
preserved, in its original shape, to our own time, though some ol their
substance has been collected ln a fragmentary form by earlier writers,
whose names are enumerated in the critique ol a modern civilian on
this subject ¹.

The application ol the word ‘curiatae' to these leges in the pas·
sage last cited lrorn the Digest leads one on to describe the origin
and early history ol the comitia or legislative assemblies ol Rome.
Τὴε earliest ol these was the comitia curiata, which, when convolced
lor certain kinds ol business, such as the sanctioning ol testaments
(inst ii. ro. 1), was called ‘comitia calata! Whatever opinion may be
held as to the names and ethnic origin ol the three tribes (Ramnes,

' Luceres, and Tities or Quirites) from whose union the Roman state
is mythically said to bave sprung, it cannot be denied that the populus
Romanus, when we first know anything certain about it, was actually
divided into three tribes, each ol which, with its distinct territory, com·
prised ten curiae, while each curia consisted often decuriae or gentes,
and each gens ol an indefinite number ol families, between which
there was originally perhaps a genuine tie ol blood, which gradually
hemme a mere fiction, respected and supported sor the sake of the
ancient family worship and religious rites The family was thus not
merelya microcosm ol the state; it was the foundation on which were
based all the privileges which the Roman citizen enjoyed within the
state; the populus⁰ contained the tribe, the tribe the curia, the curia
