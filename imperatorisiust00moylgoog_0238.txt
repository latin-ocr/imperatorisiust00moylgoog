Tinp] DE DONATIoNJBUS. 223

Aliae autem donationes sunt, quae sine ulla mortis cogita-2
tione frunt, quas inter vivos appellamus quae omnino non
comparantur legatis: quaesi fuerint perfectae, temere revo-
cari non possunt. perficiuntur autem, cum donator suam

so conditional on that event, that the property in the gift does not pass
to the donee until its occurrence ; in the meanwhile he has only its use
and enjoyment : or the property may pass at once, subject to the under-
standing tbat it is to revert to the donor in case of his proving the better
life. Where the gift is made in anticipation of some especial danger
threatening him, it is cancelled not only by the donee's prior decease, but
also so soon as that danger is survived. In any case the donor may
revoke the gift at any moment prior to his decease (ι cum quis ita donet
ut . . . reciperet si eum donationis poenituisset ’). Justinian’s later state·
ment, that in nearly all respects donationes mortis causa were govemed
by the same rules as legacies, is truer than his earlier one, that the
parallelism was complete. Thus (1) donatio m. c. was quite independent
of the fate of the inheritance: legacy depended on acceptante of the
hereditas. (2) No particular qualification in the way of commercium
was required in either donor or donee: the validity of a legacy pre·
supposed testamenti factio in both parties : similarly a filiusfamilias could
with bis pater’s consent make gifts mortis causa from his peculium pro·
fecticium, but in no case could he bequeath it. (3) Legacies were avoided
by the successful bringing of a querella inofficiosi (Tit. 18 inf), but gifts
m. c. were not so affected: ‘qui mortis causa donationem accepit a
testatore, non est similis in bac causa legatario' Dig. 34 9. 5. 17. But
among the points of resemblance are the following: (1) Ήιε rules of the
leges Furia and Voconia, Tit. 22. pr. inf. applied to both, Gaius ii. 225, 6 ;
iv. 25 (2) The provisions of the leges Iulia and Papia Poppaea (note on
Tit 14 pr. inf.) as to capacity to take legacies was extended to gifts rn. c.
by a senatus-consult, Dig. 39 6. 35. (3) By a constitution of Septimius
Severus the heir was entitled to deduct the Falcidian fourth (Tit 22 inf.)
from such gifts, Cod. 8. 57. 2 ; 6. 50. 5. (4) lf the donor became insolvent,
the creditors might impeach his gifts mortis causa: ‘narn cum legata ex
testamento eius, qui solvendo non fuit, omnimodo inutilia sunt, possunt
videri etiam donationes mortis causa factae rescindi debere, quia lega·
torum instar obtinent³ Dig. 39. 6. 17. (6) Gifts m. c, like legacies, became
void if the donor underwent capital punishment, Dig. ib. 7.

No particular form was prescribed for this class of gift unless its amount
exceeded 500 solidi, in which case it must either be registered (insinuatio
in acta) 01 made before five witnesses of the same qualification as was
required in the execution of codicilli (note on Tit. 2 5. 3inf.), Cod. 8. 57. 4.

Most editions of the institutes insert at the end of this section some
lines from Odyssey17.78-83. Tbey are not found, however, in the great
majority of the MSS, nor in the passage of Marcianus in Dig. 39. 6. 1
from which our text is obviously derived.
