Auctoritas autem tutoris in quibusdam causis necessaria
pupillis est, in quibusdam non est necessaria. ut ecce si quid
dari sibi stipulentur, non est necessaria tutoris auctoritas:
quodsi aliis pupilli promittant, necessaria est: namque placuit
meliorem quidem suam condicionem licere eis facere etiam
sine tutoris auctoritate, deteriorem vero non aliter quarn
tutore auctore. unde in his causis ex quibus mutuae obli·
gationes nascuntur, in emptionibus venditionibus, locationibus
conductionibus mandatis, depositio, si tutoris auctoritas non
interveniat, ipsi quidem qui cum his contrahunt obligantur, at

linvicem pupilli non obligantur. Neque tamen hereditatem

proper remedy was the actio de rationibus distrahendis, a penal action
by which double damages could be recovered, Dig. 26. 7. 5 5. 1 : 27. 3. 1.9.

att. XXI. The administration of property in general is carried on by
dispositions such as alienation, contract, release, and so iorth; but the
functions os a tutor relate in the main only to acts or dispositions by
which the ward’s property might be diminished: with an act os the ward
by which he is merely enriched the tutor need have nothing to do. Τὴε
most important acts os the former class are alienation and contract:
these might t‘ si procuratorem recipiebant ') be the acts os the tutor alone:
but il the actus were legitimus the ward rnust act in person. But when-
ever the latter attempted to make a disposition by which his proprietary
position might be prejudiced, it could confer no rights on other parties
unless the tutor ‘auctoritatem suam interposuit :' it was this alone that
gave the act a lull legal character: ‘tutoris auctoritas necessaria... si
lege aut legitimo iudicio agant, si se obligent, si civile negotium gerant
(eg. hereditatis aditio, note on § 1) si rem mancipi alienent . .. etiam in
rerum nec mancipi alienatione tutoris auctoritate opus est' Ulpian, reg.
11. 27. There were in lact only three cases in which a pupil could be
sued on an act of his own which had not been sanctioned by his tutor:
(1)sor his own delict, Dig. 9. 2. 5. ²3 (2) si actio ex re venit, ie. where
the obligation is merely one oi restitution‚ Dig. 44. 7. 46: 13. 6. 32 ; and
(3) where and so lar as he had been enriched by the transaction, Dig.
26. 8. 5. pr. He was' also bound ‘naturaliter' (1) by unilateral contracts,
Bk iii. 29. 3 ins, though the creditor could not assert his claim by
exceptio or even by soluti retentio, and (2) by bilateral contracts also,
the other party here being able to avail himself of all the ordinary in·
cidents of naturalis obligatio. Thus we must supply a word in the last
sentence os this section, and understand it ‘at invicem pupilli [civiliter]
non obligantur!
