captured booty belonged, primarily, 10 100 01010, 000 that it was

through the state alone that it could become the property 01 indi-
viduals. Thus, according to the view now under consideration, 00
0111κο originally owned an inch 01 Roman soil; he could only
possess and 0010111 by permission 01 100 populus, and it remained
ager publicus until the settlement 01 large numbers 01 strangers 00
Roman territory had brought into prominence the legal distinction
between civis and peregrinus, a distinction which then became em-
phasised by the former being held capable, the latter incapable, 01
owmng land ex iure Quiritium. But to maintain the principle that all
res mobiles belonged, ultimately, to the state, was less easy. On one
explanation, however, 010 famous distinction 01 Roman 100-100101
‘res mancipi’ and ‘res nec mancipi'-the traces 01 1001 principle were
retained until the distinction 110011 was swept away by Justinian. It
is suggested that the idea that all res mobiles belong ultimately 10 100
01010 survived only ia connection with certain 00010010 01 property-
things, in other words, which usually form the staple 01 military booty,
andos which individuals were thus most likely to have got possession
by 0000000100 from the state. This idea, 11 10 maintained, led to the
introduction 010 peculiar mode 01 0110001100 lor these kinds 01 oh·

ever may be the truth as to the distinction 01 res mancipi and res nec

¹ This is but oue 01 many views 00 10 100 origin 01 100 distinction. Sir Henry
010100(Αο01001 Law p. 275) says: ‘The explanation which appears 10 cover the
greatest number 01 1001000εο 10, 1001 100 0010010 01 enjoyment honoured above the
rest were the forms 01 property known first and earliest to each particular com-
manity, aud dignified therefore emphatically with the designation 01 Property.
00 100 other hand, the articles not enumerated among the lavoured 0010010 seem
10 hare been placed 00 0 lower standing. because the knowledge 01 their value
was posterior 10 the epoch 01 which the catalogue 01 superior property was settled.
They were at first unknown, rare, limited in their uses, or else regarded as
mere apperrdages 10 100 privi'eged 0010010. Thus, though the Roman res mancipi

included 0 number 01 moveable articles 01 great value, still the most costly jewels ·

were never allowed 10 take rank 00 res mancipi. 0000000 they were unknown to
the early Romaus.’ lhering thinks that cheres mancipi were those objects 01
property essential 10 100 maintenance 01 10010101 family lise: ‘ohne 001000 [i. e.
free persons aud res mancipi] 10001 [es sich ein ordentliches Hauswesen‚ eine
8000000 Wirthschait gar nicht deuken' (Geist 000 riimischen Rechts ii. p. 165).
Other explanations are based 00 100 001001 market velue (Kostbarkeit) 01 100
0010010 (Cujacius, Bynkershoek), oron the supposition that 0 special return 01 res

discussed, and the divergeut views stated, in Bbckiug, Institutionen 1 73.
