tury of the Republic it became very usual sor the praetor to vary the
rules stated in his edictum perpetuum by subsidiary edicts issued
during his year ol office. This violation os constitutionai usage
menaced the stability of the law, and accordingly was made illegal
by a lex Cornelia (nc. 67), ‘aliam deinde legem Comelius‚ etsi nemo
repugnare ausus est, multis tamen invitis, tulit, ut praetores ex edictis
suis perpetuis ius dicerent. Quae res cunctam gratiam ambitiosis prae·
toribus, qui varie ius dicere solebant, sustulit' (Asconius ad Cic. orat.
pro Comelio‚ cs. Dion Cassius xxxvi. 23).

The reference to Verres seems to make this a convenient place to
describe how the number os praetors was increased, and to point out
the bearing ol this on the development os Roman law. As will be
shortly seen, the large number of foreigners who established them·
selves at Rome ior commercial purposes led (nc. 247) to the ap·
pointment oi a second praetor, called the praetor peregrinus, who
administered justice at Rome as between foreigners or foreigners and
citizens This praetor also issued an edictum perpetuum consisting,
as will be seen, of rules 'drawn from what was known as the ius gen-
tium, a general law applicabIe to the Romans and to all people,
which became binding ior Romans mter se by being imparted steadily,
though gradually, from the edict oi the praetor peregrinus into that ol
the praetor urbanus. The former edict may thus be regarded as an
almost inexhaustible reservoir whence the praetor urbanus drew those
streams oi ius naturale by which the civil law oi Rome was expanded
and liberalised. When the territories ol the state were extended
beyond the limits oi ltaly new praetors were made. Thus, two were
created, nc. 227, sor the administration of Sicily and Sardinia, and two
more were added when the Spanish provinces were formed, ac. 197.
*Sulla increased the number from six to eight, which Julius Caesar raised
successively to ten, twelve, iourteen, and sixteen. Many of these,
and also the consuls alter their year of office, were entrusted with the
government oi a province; usually fora year, though the time was
osten prolonged. Such governors, whether proconsuls or propraetore,
were invested with imperium and jurisdiction within the limits oi
their respective provinces, and presided there as completely over the
administration of civil justice as did the praetor urbanus at Rome.
Accordingly, provincial governors naturally adopted the practice of
issuing, at the commencement of their term oi office, an edictum
stating the rules and principles which they should observe in the
exercise oi their jurisdiction. Hence arose a number os edicta pro· “
vincialia, which we should have supposed consisted partly of rules
