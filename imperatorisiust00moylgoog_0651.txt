in personam based upon a wager. The claimant of property chal·
lenged his opponent to abet upon the title: si hom0, quo de aglu,
ex iure Quiritium meus est, sestertios xxv nummos dare spondes?
(Gaius iv. 93); and it was upon this promise that the suit vas
brought, so that the action, though its proper 'aud ultimate object
was a real right, in form was in personam. To secure deliveryof
the object, along with its fruits and accessione, in the event of the
plaintiffs success, the defendant had personally to give secun'ty (pro
praede litis et vindiciarum), and the amount of the wager, being
merely trifling, was never exacted, whence its name sponsio prae·
iudicialis. For the same reason there was no restipulatio by the
defendant, as in condictio certi ¹.

lt remains to notice certain clauses which were sometimes inserted
in the formula at the instance of the defendant, viz. exceptiones and
praescriptiones pro reo. It was a peculiar mle of the fonnulary
system that the defendant was not allowed to plead some grounds
of defence in iudicio unless they had been alleged in iure, aud the
judge's attention expressly called to them by an addition to the
formula. Exceptionee are pleas of this character: defences which
do not actually traverse the allegation of the plaintiff, but set upa
countervailing right, rendering the former of at least uo present value,
and which, if they are to be successfully pleaded, require (though to
a larger extent in some classes of actions than in others) to be tersely
embodied in the formula, hyan addition to the Intenti0, instmcting
the iudex to condemn the defendant only on the fulfilment of two
conditions instead, as usual, of one, viz. (α) a positive condition, si

¹ lt was but seldom, as has been observed above, that a formula consisted ofall
the four ordinary elements (demonstratio, intentio, adiudicatio, condemnatio) al·
ready described. The composition of the different classes of formula may be sum·
marised thus :-

(a) Those of (1) real actions, (a) personal actions which are certae aad in ius con·
ceptae, and (3) actions in factum conceptae, have only intentio and condemnatio.

(h) Those of persoual actions which are in ius conceptae, but incertae, have ²⁵²
general rufe, demonstratio, intentio, aud condemnatio; the iudicia divisoria, which
belong to this class, have un adiudicatio as well.

(c) Praeiudicia (for which see Gaius iv. 44) have only au intentio. Thus

The Demonstratio never stands alone; it occurs only iu personal actious which
have an intentio incerta in ius concepta, and a civile nomeu (for in default of un
its place issupplied by praescripta umba, p. ⁶33 suph).

The Intentio is found iu every formula.

The Adiudicatio occurs only in formulae of iudicia divisoria; eud

The Condemnatio concludes every formula except those of praeiudicia, but eea·
not stand aloue.
