4an iure utimur. Item quaeritur, sicum aurifice Titio con-
venerit, ut is ex auro suo ‘certi ponderis certaeque formae
anulos ei iaceret et acciperet verbi gratia aureos decem,
utrum emptio et venditio an locatio et conductio contrahi
videatur? Cassius ait materiae quidem emptionem venditio·
nemque contrahi, operae autern locationem et conductionem.
sed placuit tantum emptionem et venditionem contrahi.
quodsi suurn aurum Titius dederit mercede pro opera con·
stituta, dubium non est,·quin locatio 'et conductio sit.

⁵ Conductor omnia secundum legem conductionis lacere
debet et, si quid in lege praetermissum luerit, id ex bono
et aequo debet praestare. qni pro usu aut vestimentorum
aut argenti aut iumenti mercedem aut dedit aut promisit, ab

all cases, but only where the land belonged to tbe church3 ii the landlord
was a lay person, writing was necessary only if and so lar as the parties
wished to modisy the regulations os the ordinary law as settled by those
two emperors, Cod. 4. 66. 1, Nov. 120. 6. 1.

§4. The opinion of Cassius had not many supporters in the time of
Gaius, who says (iii. 147) ‘plerisque placuit emptionem et venditionem
contrahi! The true criterion in such cases is given by Javolenus in Dig.
18. 1. 65 ‘toties conductio alicuius rei est, quoties materia, in qua aliquid
praestatur, in eodem statu eiusdem permanet, quoties vero et immutatur,
et alienatur, emptio magis qnam locatio intellegi debet.¹ ln iii. 146 Gaius
puts the case osone letting out gladiatore sor ‘the amphitheatre upon
terms that aspecified sum should be ‚paid sor the services os each who
carne out oi the conflict unhurt, and a much larger one lor each who was
killed or disabled ; though it was a moot point, he says the better opinion
was that it was hire so iar as the first contingency went, and sale so iar
as the last, each gladiator being the subject ol a conditional hiring anda
conditional sale, the event determining which ol the contracts wasto
oust the other.

§5. The rights and duties oi the parties respectively can most con·
veniently be arranged under the three different forms oi the contract.

i. ln locatio conductio rerum the locator must allow the conductor to

⁴ use and take the fruits oi the res locata during the time agreed upon,
unless prevented by impossibility arising from no fault olbis own, in
which case he cannot demand the merces (Dig. 19. 2. 9. 3-4; ib. 19. 6),
though, ii he has let a res aliena which its owner recovers from the con-
ductor by real action, he is liable to the latter in damages, whether in
fault urunt, Dig. 19. 2. 7-9. The thing again must be let in such a con-
dition that it can be used ior the ptnpose agreed upon, Dig. ib. 19. 1 ; is
there are delects oi which the locator was aware, he is liable in damages,
ib. ; is they were unknown to him the merces will be abated in proportion
to their importance. Burdens imposed by the law on the res locata itself
