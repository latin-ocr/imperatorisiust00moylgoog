lesse existimavit anno eam terminari. Non omnes autem
actiones, quaein aliquem aut ipso iure competunt aut a prae-
tore dantur, et in heredem aeque competunt aut dari solent.
est enim certissima iuris regula ex maleficiis poenales actiones

there was no rule os law providing that rights os action should be barred
unless issue were joined within a definite period from their accrual.

- The praetor, however, provided that many of the new actions which
he introduced through the edict should lie only within an annus utilis
from the moment at which they first accrued, though between this period
and his own limited tenure oi office there does not seem to have been the
connection suggested by Justinian in the text. By lar the most im·
portant class ol these annales actiones are the praetorian penal actions,
with the exception oi that on lurtum manifestum, which remained per-
petua because it was in commutation of a capital penalty, Gaius iv. 111 ;
iii. 189, but even these were perpetuae so far as they were brought only
to deprive the delinquent of any benefit he had derived from his wrong :
‘in honorariis actionibus sic esse definiendum Cassius ait, ut quae rei
persecutionem habeant, hae etiarn post annum darentur, ceterae intra
annum' Dig. 44 7. 35. pr. Praetorian actions which were merely uni-
laterally penal (e. g. actio doli) vvere prescribed in a year il contra ius
civile, Dig. ib. Interdicts, so far as they were penal, were similarly
limited: the actiones populares were all annales, Dig. 47. 23. 8: and
the prescription oi the aedilician actions on sale has been already noticed‚
p. 423 supr.‚ as also has the longi temporis praescriptio relatingto actions
lor the recovery ol property which had been for a defined time in the hands
ol a bona fide possessor with iustus titulus, p. 217 supr. ln course ultime
too a prescription was fixed by disconnected legislation lor other actions, in
particular one ol five years sor the querella inofliciosi testamenti, Cod. 3.
28. 36. 2. Actione which fell under the old rule were called perpetuae,
those which were limited by any oi these periods temporales.

More systematie legislation upon this matter commenced with Con·
' stantine, who enacted that all real actions which were not already limited
might be repelled by an exceptio unless brought within lorty years, cod
7. 39. 2, which subsequently seems to have been reduced to thirty, the
time here being not utile but continuum. In nn. 424 Theodosius sub-
jected to this same thirty years’ limit all actions whatsoever‚ with a lew
exceptione, which had hitherto been perpetuae, Cod. ib. 3. This rule is
in lorce under Justinian, the only actions oi importance which are not
governed by it being vindicatio in libertatem, Cod. 7. 22. 3, and fiscal
claims ior unpaid taxes, Cod. 7. 39. 6, which continued perpetual in the
old sense; so that in his compilations actio perpetua means an action
which is prescribed in not less than thirty years.

For the remedies ol the bonorum possessor and other praetorian suc·
cessors who leigned themselves heirs see Gaius iv. 34, 35.
