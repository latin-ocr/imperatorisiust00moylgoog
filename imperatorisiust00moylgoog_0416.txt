Tit. 19.] DE INUTILIBUS S T JPULA Τ IONIBUS. 401

tellegitur in his rebus quae tibi adquiri possunt. Praetereao
inutilis est stipulatio, si quis ad ea quae interrogatus erit non
responderit, veluti si decem aureos a te dari stipuletur, tu
quinque promittas, vel contra: aut si ille pure stipuletur,
tu sub condicione promittas, vel contra, si modo scilicet id
exprimas, id est si cui sub condicione vel in diem stipulanti
tu respondeas: ‘praesenti die spondeo' nam si hoc solum
respondeas ‘promitto’ breviter videris in eandem diem aut
condicionem spopondisse: nec enim necesse est in respondendo

Tit. 17. r supr; (b) where the contract was made by a guardian with
reference to his pupil's property the latter could sue by actio utilis, Dig.
12. 1. 26; (c) where the right of actual promisee would be deprived of
value unless, if necessary, the third person is allowed to appeal to the
contract: ‘cum alio conventio facta prodest, sed tunc demum, cum per
cum, cui exceptio datur, principaliter ei, qui pactus est, proficiat' Dig. 2.
14. 233 for an illustration see what is said as to the pactum de non
petendo concluded by one of two or more correi debendi in Excursus Vll
inf.

Where a promise is made to me of performance to me or Seius, the
latter is said to be ‘ solutionis causa adiectus ;' as Justinian says, the pro·
misor is entitled to release himself by performance to him, and of this
right 1 cannot deprive him ; but as there is no obligatio between him and
the promisorlDig.13. 5. 7. 1) he cannot compel performance, or enter
into any disposition with the promisor affecting it, such as novatio, accep·
tilatio, or compensatio.

But if a promise is made to me of performance to me and Seius, Seius
acquires no right whatever ; the only question being what right l acquire
myself. The Sabinians had held that 1 could claim the whole of what
bad been promised ; the view confirmed by Justinian was that of the other
school, Gaius iii. 103. Mr. Poste, referring to Dig. 18. 1.64, remarks that
the Sabinian rule was retained in formless contracts3 it would perhaps
be more correct for ‘fonnless' to substitute ‘bilateral.'

Conversely‚ if A promises that he or B will do so and so (he not being
B’s agent), he is bound to do the whole3 if that he and B will do it, he is
liable only in a moiety, Nov. 115. a.

ξ 5. The statement of the rule in the text, which is taken from Gaius
iii. 102, can hardly stand in the face of passages in the Digest in which
the contrary doctrine is emphatically laid down by other leading jurists,
viz. Ulpian, ‘si stipulanti mihi decem tu viginti respondeas, non esse con·
tractam obligationem nisi in decern constat; ex contrario si me viginti in·
terrogante tu decern respondeas, obligatio nisi in decem non erit con·
tracta . . . ‚manifestissimum est viginti et decern inesse' Dig. 45. 1. 1. 4.
So Paulus in Dig. 50, ¹7· ιο ; 45. ι. 83. 3, and Pomponius, ‘si ita stipu-
latus mero, decem autquinque dari spondes, quinque debentur3 etsi
