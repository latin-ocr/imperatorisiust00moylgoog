’111. ¹4] DE HEREDIBUS INS T [Τ UENDIS. 259

impossibilis condicio in institutionibus et legatis nec non in 10
fideicommissis et libertatibus pro non scripto habetur. Si plures 11
condiciones institutioni adscriptae sunt, si quidem coniunctim,
ut puta ‘si illud 11 111υά factum erit‚' omnibus parendum est :

si separatim, veluti ‘si illud aut illud factum erit‚' cuilibet
obtemperare satis est.

Hi, quos numquam testator vidit, heredes institui possunt. 12
veluti si fratris filios peregri natos ignorans qui essent heredes

instituerit: ignorantia enim testantis inutilem institutionem
non facit.

fulfils the condition, and becomes at once entitled to the inheritance‚ by
giving security that if he breaks the condition he will transfer the estate
to those entitled next after him (cautio Muciana). And even any one
conditionally instituted could, before the fultilment 01 the condition,
obtain provisional bonorum possessio from the 'praetor by giving the
same security, Dig. 37. 11. 5. pr.; a. 8. 12. 11 he did not avail himself 01
this privilege, and the condition was one whose fulrilment was entirely
within his own control (e. g. si servum suum manumiserit), the creditors
of the estate could get a limit of time fixed within which he must fultil
the condition or forfeit his right, Dig. 18. 5. 23. 1: if the condition was
not of this kind (e. g. si Titius consul factus erit) the creditors could
obtain agrant of possessio of the inhen'tance, and pay themselves from
the proceeds 01 its sale, Dig. ib. 23 2.

§10.1mpossib1e conditions are those which cannot be fultilled
either (1) on natural grounds (physically impossible, e. g. Bk. iii. tp 11),
or (2) on jural grounds (⁴ veluti sororem nupturam sibi aliquis stipulatur'
Dig. 45. 1. 35. 1) : turpes (immoral) condiciones are treated in the same
way as those which cannot legally be performed Dig. 28. 7. 15. A
further distinction is that between conditions which are absolutely or
objectively impossible, and those which are only relatively impossible;
by the latter being meant such as might have been performed under
other circumstances, but which under existing circumstances cannot:
e. g. release of a non-existent debt, or manumission 01 a slave who is
dead. Between these, however, and those which are objectively impos·
sible there is, in general, 110 difference of treatment 01 effect: Dig. 28.
5. 4 33 ib. 7. 6; Savigny, System iii. p. 165. A contract made subject
to an impossible condition was void, Bk. 111. 19.11inf.: the Proculians
had maintained the same of testamentary dispositions, but the Sabinians
held that an impossible condition in a will ought to be taken pronon
scripto, though Gaius himself (111. 98) admitted the unreasonableness of
the distinction between wills and contracts, which nevertheless was con·
firmed by Justinian. A condition whose fulfilment becomes impossible
only after the making of the will does not come within the rule, Dig. 45.
