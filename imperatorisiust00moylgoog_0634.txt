EARLIER HISTORV OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 619

system ol actions tried before a judge or judges toolr its origin. The
earliest judges derived their judicial authority, such as it was, not lrom
the state, but from the voluntary submisslon ol the parties: and
Sir qullaine has shown ¹, by an examination ol the earliest Roman
civil process, that the magistrate, even when commissioned by the
state sor the administration of justice, preserved the memory of the
actual historical source ol his iunctione by ‘carelully simulating the
demeanour ol a private arbitrator casually called in.' The later Roman
jurists, though struck by the similarity iu procedure between an ordi·
nary action and a reference to arbitration, were guilty ol the carious
anachronism ol deriving the latter from the former: ‘compromissum'
(one ol them says) ‘ad similitudinem iudiciorum redigitur3' but the
lact is that action grew out ol arbitration, and the judge was originally
only an unofficial releree3 a lact ol which traces are observable
throughout the legal history ol Rome. Thus, no action could
validly be commenced, still less carried through to judgment, until the
court had got both parties belore it: lor arbitration can take place
only by consent, not by a unilateral act ol either ol them without the
other. Still more lorcibly are we reminded ol the mode in which the
early judge acquired his jurisdiction by the vitality ol the rule that no
judge could be forced upon a party of whose knowledge and integrity
be was not satisfied: ‘neminem' says Cicero ², ‘voluemnt maiores
nostri non modo de existimatione cuiusquam, sed ne pecuniaria quidem
de re minima esse iudicem, nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset!
Hence too the limited authority, as we should deem it, ol the Roman
iudex ; he has no‘imperium;' he cannot compel the parties to any
actor forbearance3 be is merely a releree whom they have chosen,
and in whose appointment the magistrate has cooperated ; all he has
to do is to decide the questions submitted to him, so lar as the par-
ties may enable him; he basto leave to them the realization (by exe·
cution) ol the right he ascertains. The very point he has actually to
settle is at first lrept studiously in the baclrground, and hidden behind
a wager ; the decision is not an order or injunction, but an expression
os opinion, sententia, pronuntiatio.

lu England we know lrom actual records with what rapidity trial by
jury in civil causes, though in most cases optional only, superseded the
more barbarous methods ol compurgation‚ ordeal, and trial by battle,
and that this was largely due to asense ol the greater justice and reason·
ableness ol the new system. We can hardly doubt that upon much
the same grounds the practice ol arbitration daily gained greater
