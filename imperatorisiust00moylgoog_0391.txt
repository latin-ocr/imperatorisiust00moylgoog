gave the magistrate the option of either applying the harsher procedure,
or putting the creditor in possession of the debtor's property.

ln the second place, if a system of real execution had existed at
Rome from the time of the Twelve Tables onwards, and with the width of
operation which Savigny assigns to it, the rules by which it was regulated
must bave formed no inconsiderable body of law, which (one might
reasonably suppose) would have been mentioned by general writers, and
even been described at length by those who specially concemed them·
selves with legal topica This, however, is not the case. It can hardly be
denied that in isolated cases the praetor allowed a debtors estate to bc
seized and sold, and Savigny cites an instance of this even before the lex
Poetilia (Livy ii. 24) ; but we have the express statement again of Gaius
(iv. 35) that the systematic employment of such a procedure was believed
to date from the praetorship of Publius Rutilius, doubtless the well known
statesman and jurist who was consul tac. 105: ‘quae species actionis .. .

a praetore Publio Rutilio, qui et bonorum venditionem introduxisse ·

dicitur, comparata est.¹ If bonorum venditio, as a system of execution
in bankruptcy standing in contrast with manus iniectio, had existed from
the beginning of Roman legal history, we may surely presume that the
fact would have been known to Gaius.

ln the text before us Justinian connects the disappearance of bonorum
venditio with the abolition of the iudicia ordinaria. lt seems more
probable that both its disappearance, and the procedure in use under
Justinian himself, were in some way due to or connected witha senatus-
consult passed under one of the earlier emperors, and mentioned in
Dig. 27. 10. 5 and 9, by which it was provided that where the bankmpt
was of senatorial rank, and the creditors assented, instead of the estate
being sold en bloc (bonorum venditio), a curator bonorum should be
appointed by the magistrate for the purpose of disposing of the assets
piecetneal andin lots‚ and paying the creditore pro rata out of the
proceeds. The ordinary execution in bankruptcy of Justinian's time
(bonorum distractio, Bk. ii. ¹9· 1 supr.) was very similar in character.
The creditors, or some of them, applied to the magistrate for missio in
bona: from the grantiog of this application an interval was allowed for
others to come in and prove their claims by action, those who resided in
the same province having two, others four years for this purpose. As
soon as it had elapsed, those who had not yet proved their claims were
excluded from all benedt in the proceedings, and could demand satis·
faction out of the bona possessa only if a balance remained after paying
the rest in full, Cod. 7. 72. ro, unless they were hypothecary creditors,
in which case, if they preferred it, they could rely exclusively on their
real right, and take no part in the liquidation at all. During the two or
four years the estate, though technically possessed by the creditors who
had been missi in possessionem, was admistered by a curator, whom
other creditore made their defendant (and not the bankrupt himself) in
