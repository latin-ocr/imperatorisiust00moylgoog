contract as to make quasi-contract their most reasonable denomination:
but the fault of Justinian is that nothing which he says about quasi·
contract suggests any general criterion by which one can precisely draw
the line between it and contract proper, or which accounts sor the exist-
ence of an obligation in the particular instances by which he illustrates
the conception. But the idea oi quasi-delict, which is open to the same
objection, is further to be condemned as really unnecessary, as will
appear from the cases by which it is exemplified (Blc iv. 5 inl), most of
which are instanccs ol vicarious responsibility analogous to the liabilityin
tort os a railway company or other employer for the wrong-doing or
negligence ol its servants. lts existence is to be accounted for purely
on historical grounds (see Hunter’s Roman Law p. xxxvi), and it is to be
regretted that Justinian tolerated its survival The actual sources oi
obligation in Roman law may more logically be arranged as follows:
(1)Agreement‚ comprising the iour classes ol contracts, the so-called
innominate contracts, and pacta vestita. (2) Quasi-contract, including
tutela, cura, negotiorum gestio, joint inheritance, joint ownership not
arising ex contractu, litis contestatio, and perhaps the unjust enrichment
osone man at the cost oi another (cf. Tit. 141 with Tit. 27. omi).
(3) A person’s mere ‘unilateral' expression of will (exemplified by some
cases of pollicitatio, e. g. Dig. 50. 12. 1. 1, ib. 2, though as a general
rule ‘ex nuda pollicitatione nulla actio nascitur' Paul. sent. rec. 5. 12. 9),
or that of another by whose decease one has taken a benefit (exempliiied
by legacy and fideicommissum). (4) Judgment or magisterial order.
(5) Delict. For an enumeration of the sources os obligation in English
law see Sir W. R. Anson's Law os Contract (Introductory chapter).

The idea os agreement (conventio or pactio) underlies that of con·
tractus: ‘et est pactio duorum pluriumve in idem placitum consensus'
Dig. 2. 14 1. 2. lts analysis into the elements of offeror proposal and
acceptance is the work rather of general jurisprudence than of a particular
system, which has been done once ior all by Savigny, Oblig. ξ 52,

Pactio then is the genus oi which contractus is the species: the
differentia lies in the circumstance that to certain pacta or pactiones a
civilis obligatio was annexed by the older Roman civil law in virtue
either of their nature, or of their being attended by some other fact
besides the mere fact of agreement. That, through which a pactum is
also a contract, is usually called its causa civilis, and of such causae
civiles there are four, viz. (1) res, delivery of ownership, possession or
detention ot' an object by the creditor, whence the four Real Contracts.
(2) The expression of the agreement in a certain verbal form (obligatio
verborum), that oi question and answer (stipulatio) being regarded as the
verbal contract par excellence. (3) The employment ol writing in a
manner peculiarly characteristic os the Romans, whence the obligatio
