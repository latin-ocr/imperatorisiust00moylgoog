EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 63b

Ol the proceedings in iudicio Gaius gives us no information; they
consisted, ol course, ol evidence and argument, and may be passed
over in favour of matters ol which we have more accurate knowledge.
Assuming‚ however, that they terminate in a sententia sor the plaintiff
(condemnatio), two uew questions present themselves. Firstly, is the
judgment finali or is there any system ol appeal? And, secondly,
how is the defendant compelled to pay the money in which he has
been condemned? in other words, what are the proceedings in a
Roman execution?

The strictly coordinata authority ol' the ‘magistratus maiores' in
republican Rome excluded the possibility ola true appellate juris·
diction in the pre-imperial period. At that time, in lact, the sententia
ol a iudex did not admit ol revocation or alteration save by the
process ol in integmm restitutio (note on Blr. iv. 6. 33), though it must
be remembered that judgment in an ordinary action was not abso·
lutely final ; sor the defendant, who was presumptively condemnatus,
could contest its validity by refusing to pay the sum iu which he had
been condemned, and delending himself, at the n'slr of condemnatio
in duplum, against the actio iudicati brought lor its recovery. This,
however, was not an appeal, which implies the rehearing ot' the suit
by ahigher tribunal. With the tall of the Republic aregular appel·
late jurisdiction was rapidly developed, and the privilege ol ‘ appealing
unto Caesar' was soon understood to be common to citizens ol
Rome all over the empire. Under Augustus the praelectus urbi was
judge ol appeal lor Rome, and a vir consularis, though sitting in
the capital, bore the same relation to each ol the provinces. Nero

invested the Senate with a supreme appellate iurisdiction coordinate
¹ with his own, and by the time of M. Aurelius the right had been
established ol appealing from the sententia ola iudex to the magis-
trate who appointed him. Thus the tribunals had gradually arranged
themselves in a definite series ol higher and lower instance, and a suit
might be carried from iudex to Emperor through the appointing'
municipal magistrate, the praetor or praeses, and the praefectus urbi
or praetorio in succession. The procedure on appeal was that which
will shortly be described as ‘extraordinaria' dispensing, in ,its com-
mencement, with the ordinary institution by formula, and terminatiug
in a decretum, not a sententia; definite periods os time were pre·
scribed within which the appeal must be lodged, and its various
stages completed. A powerlul checlt on rash appeals was the

lts alienation unlawlul pendente lite, Galus iv. 117. (6) lt preventa any subsequent
change in the parties without complete recoustmctiou oi the formula (Translatio).
