than scientific. Not far different 11011 this is the sense which it bears
in certain passages 01 the Digest (e. g. 47. 4.1.1“; 16. 3. 31. 1)
as equivalent to ‘rati0,’ the correspondence between a legal rule or
institution and the spirit 01 civil or natural law. In other passages
aequitas denotes (α) the agreement between rules 01 positive law and
the natural sense 01 right (eg. naturalis aequitas Dig.a.r4.1pr.;
37. 5. 1 pr), () the decision 01 1 legal question with special
reference to the circumstances 01 the case (Dig. 44. 14 pul, or (c)
equity in the modern sense, ie. mitigation 01 strict law in accordance
withahigher sense 01 justice (eg. Dig. 1. 3. 253 4. 1. 7 711.; 15. 1.

The ius praetorium, which, as we have already seen, was contrasted
hythe Roman lawyers with the ius civile, though equally with it a part
01 the positive law 01 Rome, originated in the ius edicendi possessed

hythe higher magistrates. The distinction between magistratus
maiores and minores was connected with the right to take the

auspices; auspicia maxima might be taken only by consuls and
praetors, on whom ‘iustum imperium auspiciumque domi et militiae'
were conterred by a lex curiata. The imperium carried with it also the
ius decernendi; a magistrate invested with imperium had the right 01
issuing a decretum, 01 summoning a citizen (vocatio) to appear belore
him by his lictors, 01 enlorcing obedience to his orders hy the strong
arm 01 the law. Some ol the magistratus minores eg. the tribuni
plebis, had the ius prensionis, the right 01 arresting persons present
belore thern and keeping thern in detention ; others had neither
vocatio nor prensio. The praetor, however, 1110, as has been re·
marked, was the supreme judicial magistrate, and who by means 01
his ius edicendi was enabled to gradually develop a system 01 law iu
which the ius civile was eventuglly swallowed up, had little oppor-
tunity 01 modisying existing law,·still less 01 introducing new mles,
in the earliest period 01 his activity. This incapacity arose lrom the
system ol procedure (legis actiones) sanctioned hythe Twelve Tables
and somewhat expanded by later legislati0n3 the forms ol actions
were rigidly prescribed by statute, and the magistrate had no power
to directly alter 01 extend them; 110111 the sorms 01 actions only could
a citizen 'deduce the rights which were guaranteed him hythe civil
law. The only mode in which the praetor could enlorce a legal
principle not contained in that law was by an exercise 01 his im·
perium; he could compel a party to enter into a wager (sponsio)
with his adversary‚ and the lact upon which the wager turned could
then be decidcd in a legis actio. This, sor instance, was the origin
