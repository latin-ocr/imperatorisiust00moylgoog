The Twelve Tables had also allowed the relations of a person who had
suffered an aggravated outrage to sue for talio on his behalf, p. 5²² supr. 3
and the legis actio repetundarum could, under the statutes by which it
was regulated (e. g. Calpurnia, Servilia), be brought by a Roman citizen
on behalf ol the persons really injured.

The introduction of tlre formulary procedure facilitated representation
of defendants no less than ol plaintiffs. From this time onward it was
allowed by the praetor with but slight limitations ; tlre desired end being
attained hythe principal's name appearing irr the intentio of the formula,
the agent’s in the condemnatio; e. g. ‘si paret Caium Seio (principal)
sestertium decem milia dare oportere, iudex Caium Titio (agent) ses-
tertium decem milia condemna: sinon paret, absolve (Gaius iv. 86, 87).
Of such agents there were two types. The older of these is the cognitor,
who was appointed for a single action (inlitam) in the presence of the
other party, certis et sollennibus verbis, the formulae os which are pre-
served by Gaius iv. 83. There could thus be no question of tlre cog-
nitor’s authority, and consequently he was identified with his principal
throughout ; his processual acts affected the latter exactly as il they had
been his own: ‘domiui loco habetur' Gaius iv. 97. The other is the
procurator, who might be a general agent, acting even without corn-

mission; ‘quinetiam suut qui putant vel eum procuratorem videri, cui l
non sit mandatum, si modo bona fide accedat ad negotium, et caveat l

rem ratam dominum habiturum3 igitur etsi non edat mandatum pro·
curator, nihilominus agere posse, quia saepe mandatum initio litis in
obscuro est, et postea apud iudicem ostenditur' Gaius iv. 84 The pro-

curator thus stood upon an altogether different footing from the cognitor, ἶ

for the alleged principal might turn out to be no principal at all, or at

any rate not to have consented to the agent's bringing or defending the .

action for him: consequently‚ he was not identified witlr the latter, as
the cognitor was, and was in lact the real party to the action himself.
Hence, if he appeared as plaintili, tlre principal’s right of action was not
consumed, so that he could subsequently sue upon it himself (Gaius iv.
98), and tlre agent alone could bring actio iudicati against the defendant,
il condemned, fragm. Vat. 3173 if he appeared as defendant, it was he,
and not the principal, against whom the actio iudicati must be brought
if the case went against him. The general consequence of this non-

identification of procurator with his dominus was that he was allowed ’

to appear as plaintiff or defendant only upon tlre condition that the other
party to the action was fully protected against the rislr of the principal's
disowning his proceedings by subsequently sulng upon the same ground
himself, or by refusing to satisfy an adverse judgment. This was affected
by tlre system of security described in the next Title.

Between Gaius and Justinian tlre cognitor disappeared, and when
there was no doubt that a procurator really was what he held himself
