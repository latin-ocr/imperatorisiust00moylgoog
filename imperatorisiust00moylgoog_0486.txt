appears to be that when a eontract is lor the interest of both parties
although their interests are rather adverse than identical, each is re-
sponsible lor the least negligence:’ ‘in contractibus bonae lidei serva-
tur, ut si quidem utriusque contrahentis commodum versetur, etiam

gestio) in which, though the relation is all sor the interest os one party,
exacta diligentia is required from the other; and others in which,
though both parties are interested, they are yet expected to show only
talem diligentiam qualern in suis rebus adhibere solent, eg, partners,
coheirs, and colegatees.

Aeciden, fortuitus casus (which is mentioned in Bk. ili. ¹4· a and .
elsewhere in the Institutas), and dolus form the two extremes os a
chain ol possible sets ol circumstances, the responsibility for which
may be exhibited thus. For accident, and lor such unintentional
faults and mistakes as could not have been guarded against by the
utmost care, no one is answerable. Culpa levis entails liability on the
