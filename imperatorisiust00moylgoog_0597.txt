11441 Dig. 44. 2. 3. (1) The right asserted in the second action must be
the same as that asserted in the first. F or instance, the res has not been
iudicata, because the quaestio is not eadem, ir what was decided iu the
first snit was 4 question 41 possession, while in the second we bave a
question 41 ownership, Dig. 44. 2. 14 3, 41 where a condictio relates to
the same obJect which bas previously been claimed by vindicatio, Dig.
ib. 11. 15. Β111, granted that the right alleged is the sarne, it is immaterial
that the second action is 41 4 1111141441 nature from the first : ‘de eadem
re agere videtur et qui non eadem actione agit, qua ab initio agebat, sed
etiarn si alia experiatur, de eadem tamen re’ Dig. ib 5. For examples
41 difference 41 actions involving the same right 41. Dig. 44. 4. 3. 7 (here-
ditatis petitio and vindicatio) ; ib. 8 (hereditatis petitio and actio 1411111144
erciscundae); ib. 24 (vindicatio and actio Publiciana). Granted, again,
that the right alleged is the same, it is immaterial that in the first action
a point was decided incidentally only which sonns the principal question in
the second, though by the praescriptio praeiudicii orexceptiopraeiudicialis
(Cic. de invent. 2. 20) the defendant was enabled to postpone such inci-
dental determination 41 an issue which was all-important in another
suit

lt is 411411 said that the identity 41 the object to which the right in
either action relates is an essential condition 41 exceptio rei iudicatae ; eg.
‘curn quaeritur, baec exceptio noceat necne? inspiciendum est an idern
corpus sit’ Dig. 44. 2. 12 ; but, though it may usually be inferred that
the quaestio is eadem 114111 1114 identity 41 the res, it is really immaterial
that the res are different 11 the right is substantially identical in the two
actions ; e. g. 114 plaintifs demands first the whole, and later a part 41 that
whole, Dig. ib. 7. pr.,or 11114 claims first an ancilla, and then a child
conceived by her atter litis contestatio in that action, ib. 7. 1, 1114 ex·
ceptio can be pleaded with effect.

11 1114 right alleged 111 the two actions is the same, but is based, in the
second, upon a different title 114111 that affirmed in the first, a distinction
must be drawn between real and personal actions. 11 1114 action was
real, the defendant was 1141 estopped from pleading the exceptio by the
difference 41 11114, 141 1114 right is the same however it may have been
acquired: ‘neque enirn amplius quarn semel res mea esse potest ς’ 41141
consequently ‘omnes causae (titles) una petitione apprehenduntur’ Dig.
44, 2. 14 2. The only exception to this rule 4411411114 older law was,
that where the title advanced in the second had accrued since the
decision in the first action (causa superveniens) ; later it seems to have
been allowable to specifya single title in a real action (causa expressa
agere), the plaintifs thereby being held to save his right 41 subsequently
claiming the same property by 4 1111141441 4114, Dig. 44 2. 11. 4; ib. 14. 4.
But in obligations the plaintifl‘s right differs with the mode in which the
particular obligation arose : ‘actiones in personam ab actionibus in rem
