Tit. tp] DE HEREDUM QUALIT AT E ET DIFFERENT IA. 277

commune omnibus subiectis imperio nostro hoc praestavit
beneficium et constitutionem tam aequissimam quam nobilem

scripsit, cuius tenorem si observaverint homines, licet eis adire
hereditatem et intantum teneri, in quantum valere bona
hereditatis contingit: ut ex hac causa neque deliberationis
auxilium eis fiat necessarium, nisi omissa observatione nostrae
constitutionis et deliberandum existimaverint et sese veteri
gravamini aditionis supponere maluerint. Item extraneus?

etsi propter simplicitatem praesentis legis subtilitatem non observaverint,
intantum tamen teneantur, quantum in hereditate invenerint!

By the important change to which he here allodes Justinian effected a
complete reformation in the Roman law of inberitance, so far as relates
to the character and liabilities of the heres. As Mr. Hunter says (Roman
Law p. 574), ‘it was a bold and successful stroke to convert the heir into
a mere official, designated by the deceased for the purpose of winding up
his affairs and distributing his property. The heir was now a mere
executor, with the privilege of being residuary legatee, and if the testator
did not forbid it, of retaining the Falcidian fourth.¹

By this enactment (Cod. 6. 30. 22) Justinian gave the person to whom
the hereditas was delata, whether ab intestato or under a will, the option
between applying for a spatium deliberandi, and making a complete
inventory of the property of the deceased. lf he chose the latter, he
must, with the assistance of a notary andaprescribed number of witnesses
representing the creditors and legatees, begin the inventory within one
month of his becoming avare of his right, and linish it within two months
more: if, however, be was at a distance, be was allowedayear. During this
interval neither creditors nor legatees might molest him in any way,
though at its termination they could require him to swear to the accuracy
of the inventory, which be also had to sign. By selecting this procedure,
the heir was exempted from all liability beyond the assets of the deceased,
Cod loc. cita, and also from the obligation of ascertaining rights of
priority, etc. among creditors 3 these and legatees were to be pald in the
order in which they applied to him, and if the assets were exhausted un·

, paid creditors might resort to paid legatees, Cod. ib. 4-8. The universitas
iuris in fact no longer passed to the heir: there was no confusio between
his proprietary relations and those of the deceased, so that iura in re
aliena and debts were no longer affected in the way described, p. 275 supr,
Cod ib. 9.

lf the institutus or person entitled preferred to apply for a spatium
deliberandi, bis old liabilities remained, ib. 14: even in this case he must
make an inventory ; if he did not, and accepted the inberitance, he lost
his right to the Falcidian fourth, and must pay legacies and fideicommissa
in full. The practical result, as Mr. Hunter remarks, was that if there
was any doubt as to the solvency of the hereditas, the heir was compelled
to make an inventory.
