THE EDICTUM PERPETUUM-THE PRUDENTES. 43

would doubtless bave been carried on by other organs; for instance,
we ltnow tbat a fresh impulse was given to the growth of the praeto·
rian law of succession by the lex Papia Poppaea in the time of
Augustus. But, as a matter of fact, the two praetors at Rome, 3ηά the
governors in tlte provinces, continued to issue their annual edicta
under not only Augustus but also his successors, and the ius gentium
was still, as before, being constantly worked into the legal system, and
alterations and additions being made in that large part of the urban
edict which had now been handed down from praetor to praetor for
generations. These additions 3ηά alterations, however, were in the
main occasioned by contemporaneous legislation (e. g. the leges Fal-
cidia, Iulia et Papia, and various senatus consulta) ; for we may venture
to suppose that, when the comitia passed no statutes which were not
originated by tbe emperor, a magistrate would have hesitated to repeal
or alter, or extend the law, with the independence which had been
usual under the free Republic.

From the time of Hadrian (an. try—138) the formal separation
which hasbeen noticed between the respective edicts of successive
praetors ceased to erist. That emperor divided the whole ol Italy
into Rome, with its immediately surroundlng territory, and four other
districts3 Rome and its suburbs remained under the authority of the
old magistrates, and among themoi the praetor, while the other
districts were placed under the administration of a new class of
officials, called at first consulares, and after M. Aurelius (mn. ror-180)
iuridici. With this change was in all probability connecteda still more
sweeping reform effected by Hadrian. ln tlte year 131 rt. o. he issued,
through Salvius Julianus, praetor designate,a revised edition of the
edicts of tlte praetores urbanus aad peregrinus, arranged in a sys-
tematic form, in which also the edictum provinciale and aediliciam
edict seem to a large degree to have been incorporated. This, which
was called tlte ‘edietum perpetuum’ por excellence, was published
with the force of law for the whole empire, and the ius honorarium
from this time onward ‘legis vicem obtinuit: instead of depending for
its validity on an annual re-enactment. Henceforward t00, though
tbe magistrates formally retained their ius edicendi, the old practice,
according to which each praetor issued an edictum perpetuum at the
commencement of his year of office, was relinquished; the jurists
after Hadrian regard tbe eilict of their own time as something perma-
nent and unalterable, except by the action of the emperor; and
Hadrian himself evidently directed that any defect which might sub·

sequently be discovered ln the law should be supplied by imperial
