THE GENERAL NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS. 463

the creditor is unable to sue. Two such reasons have a very err-
tensive operation, viz.-

(r) insufficiency os fonn in contracta. We shall see thatin Roman
law agreements were actionable only ii they were clothed in a definite
sorm, or belonged to one or other oi certain classes specially favoured3
exactly as in English law no promise is legally binding unless made
either under seal or sor valuable consideration. Agreements which
neither belonged to the favoured classes, nor were enpressed in the
proper form, were nuda pacta, and unactionable, although (according
to Savigny and many other writers) they gave rise to a natural obliga·
tion enlorceable in other ways. This is inferred in particular lrom
Dig. a. 14. 7. 4 ‘igitur nuda pactio obligationem· non parit, sed parit
exceptionem,' ib. ι’. pr. ‘huius edicti aequitas naturalis est: quid
enim tam congruum fidei humanae, quarn ea, quae intereos placu-
erunt, servari,' Dig. 4& 3. 5. a ⁴. . . puta, quaedam earum [usurarum]
ex stipulatione, quaedam ex pacto naturaliter debebantur: . . . et sicut
ex pacti conventione datae repeti non possunt3’ cf. Dig. ib. 95. 4.
On the other hand, the passage last cited is the only one in which the
effect ol producing natural obligation is directly attributed to amere
pact; and on account ol this insufficiency ol evidence there are many
who hold that Savigny is not iustitied in affirming namral obligation
asan incident ol nuda pacta in general. Most directly they are sup·
ported by Dig. 45. r. r. a ‘si quis ita interroget, dabis? responderit,
quidni? et is utique in ea causa est, ut obligetur. Contra si sine
verbis adnuisset, non tantum autem civiliter, sed nec naturaliter obli·
gatur, qui ita adnuit: et ideo recte dictum est, non obligari pro eo
nec fideiussorem quidem!

(a) A person's defective capacity os right or disposition. Thus,
between pater and filiusfamilias, and between master and slave, there
could he natural obligation only, and even toan extranea persona a
slave could not be bonvm civiliter. The SC. Macedonianum (Bk. iv.
7. 7 and notes inl.) affords another example: a disputed case is that
ol contracte made by a pupillus without his guardian's auctoritas; see
on ut. i. ar. pr. supr.

Sometimes, moreover, an obligation which was originally civilis
ceased to be actionable, and became naturalis. (a) In some cases the
praetor, on principles ol equity, disregarded strict civil law rules so sar
asto permit the survival, in a‘natural' form, ol an obligation which
had iure civili ceaaed altogether to exist, eg. where a creditor became
heir to his debtor, and in capitis deminutio, ‘hi qui capite minuuntur,
ex his causis, quae capitis deminutionem praecesserunt, manent obli·
