stricte concludentem, fideicommissis autem, quae ex voluntate

missis exaequare, ut nulla sit inter ea differentia, sed quod
deest legatis, hoc repleatur ex namra fideicommissorum et, si
quid amplius est in legatis, per hoc crescat fideicommissi
natura. sed ne in primis legum cunabulis permixte dehis

any active obligation at all, Gaius ii. 213-14: if per damnationem, the
remedy was in personam only. (3) ln respect of the effect of a git ·
of the same thing to two or more persons disiunctim, Gaius ii. 205
The importance of these distinctions of form was much reduced by the
SC. Neronianum, nt). 64, which apparently enacted that whichever of
the four fomrulae was actually employed, it should he construed as
though it were that most favourable to the legatee, i. e. per damnationem:
‘SC⁰. Neroniano cautum est, ut quod minus aptis (or ratis) verbis legatum
est, perinde sit ac si optimo iure legatum esset: optimum autem ius
legati per damnationem est’ Ulpian, reg. 24 11: though it is possible
that this enactment, while requiring still the use of Latin, dispensed with
the necessity of any set form whatever. Some hundreds of years later
testatore were enabled by enactments of Constantius, nn. 339, and
Theodosius ΙΙ, an. 439, to give legacies in any words they chose, whether
Greek or Latin, Cod. 6. 37. 21 ; 6. 23. 21. 6. Justinian's own regulations,
mentioned in this and the following sections, assimilated the civil law
bequest (legatum) so far as was possible to fideicommissa, the nature of
which will appear from Tits. 23 and 24 inf. Any legal superiority which
either had possessed over the other was in future to be common to both,
and the object of a bequest, whether technically a legatum ora fidei·
commissum, was to be recoverable by the beneficiary by the most ap·
propriate remedy, real or personal. The legatee acquired a real right to
the res legata in every case where ithelonged to the testator, and in no
other, unless indeed the testator himself expressed a contrary intention,
Cod.6.43. 1 ; he acquired a personal right against the heir in every
case, and this was secured by a statutory hypotheca, first given by
Justinian himself, over everything which the person on whom the legacy
or fideicommissum was charged had himself received from the inherit-
ance, Cod. 6. 43. a.

commissa see on Tit. ²³· 1 inf.
