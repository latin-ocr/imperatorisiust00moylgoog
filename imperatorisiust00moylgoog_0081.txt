66 INT RODUC Τ ΙΟΝ.

bya brief indication os their respective subject-matter, and the ex-
cerpts from the writings os the jurists, oi which the Titles consisted,
were distinguished by the name of the jurist and ol the specific work
from which they were taken. Not unfrequently a single sentence was
made up out oi several extracts, consisting each ola very lew words
which depend lor their meaning on a context supplied from one or
more other jurists ¹. The further division oi longer excerpts into a
principium and numbered paragraphS, which is found in modern
editions of the Corpus iuris, is of far later origin.

The whole work was called Pandeetae or Digesta, the latter name
being derived perhaps irom Justinian's expression in the ordinance
appointing the commission (¹codex in quinquaginta libros digestus ¹),
or more probably from a work of Salvius Julianus which bore the
same title. It was published on Dec. roth, 533, with statutory lorce
from the goth of thc same mouth, and the use oi the juristic wtitings
from which it was compiled was lor the future interdicted3 along with
the Code and the Institutas, it was intended to form the exclusive

»authority lor the earlier law. Though the names of their authors had
been prefixed to the individual excerpts, Justinlan ordained that they
should be taken to be immediately enacted by himself, and to derive
their force irom him, not from the reputation ol the jurist or srom the
emperor who had conferred on him the ius respondendi3 linally, in
order to prevent all controversies in the future, he lorbade all com·
mentaries on the Digest, allowing only Greek paraphrases and sum·
marles ol the contents: ‘ Omnibus similiter interdicimus, ne quis audeat
bominum, qui sunt nunc, aut in posterum erunt, commentarios scri-
bere harum legum, praeterquam si velit quis in Graecam linguam
haec transferre, quem etiam volumus sola secundum pedem seu :ard
πόδα nuncupata uti legum interpretatione, et siquid secundum nomi-
natorum paratitlorum, ut conveniens est, adscribere voluerit usum.
Aliud autem nihil omnino ne tantillum quidem circaea lacere, nec
rursum dare seditionis et dubitationis. aut infinitae multitudinis legibus
occasionem' (Justinian in Const. ‘dedit nobis,' 21).

With the completion of the Code and the Digest, which between
them exhausted all the sources ol Roman law, Justinian's plan was

¹ Eg. Dig. 6. a. 3-7 (Ulp. lib 16 ad edict.) item si res ex causa iudicati sit
tradita; (Paul. lib. 19 ad edict.) vel solvendi causa; (Uip. loc. cit.) vel ex causa
noxae deditionis, sive vera cansa sit sive salsa ; (Paul. lec. cit.) item si servum ex
causa noxali quianon defendebatur, iussu praetoris duxero, et amisero posses·
sionem, competit mihi Publicium (Ulp. loc. cit.) sed et si res iudicata sit, Pub-
liciam actio competit.
