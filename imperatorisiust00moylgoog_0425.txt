The principal consequences ol mora debitoris are as follow t

(1) The debtor must compensate the creditor sor the loss ol all
advantage which he would have had it the act had been duly performed
(omnis causa), especially truite, Dig. 22. 1. 38. ις, and interest, ib. 32. 2.
Is, however, the obligation was to pay certa pecunia, interest on mora
could not be claimed: see on Tit. 14. pr. supr. (2) Aster he is once in
mora, the debtor is not released by performance becoming impossible,
even without his fault, Dig. 12. 1.3 ; in other words, even though under the Δ
contract he was liable lor culpa lata only, he now becomes answerable not
only sor culpa levis but also lor casus: and il the object ol the obligation
has become less valuable, he must pay the highest value it has had since
it became due, Dig. 13. 3. η. 1. (3) ln bilateral contracts the one party
can withdraw from the compact, il to accept performance after mora of
the other would seriously prejudice him: e. g. il possession of a farm is
not given to the lessee at the date agreed upon, and in the meanwhile he
has taken another, Dig. 19. 2. 24. 4. (4) lt' it has been agreed that the
creditm³s right shall expire within a certain period, mora debitoris occur·

· ring within that period cancels the agreement, Dig. 34 3. 3. 1 and 2.

Mora debitoris was ‘purged' by extinction ol the obligation, by the
creditors either expressly or tacitly granting him grace, and hythe latter
tendering performance to the former, including compensation lor all loss
which the mora had entailed upon him.

The chief effects ol mora creditoris were ( i) that the debtor was released
by performance becoming impossible save through his own dolus or
culpa lata, Dig. 18. 6. 16 and 18 ; in other wordS, he became answerable
lor culpa lata only, even though previously answerable lor culpa levis;
(2) that the creditor has to compensate the debtor sor any loss which the
refusal to accept performance properly tendered entails upon him, Dig.

sit. XX Under the older law suretyship could be contracted ‘verbis'
in two other ways, sponsio (spondesi spondeo) and fidepromissio (fide-
promittis? fidepromitto); but only debts incurred by stipulation could
be guaranteed by either or' them. No one could be a sponsor except a
civis, and unless both the parties to the principal contract were cives
also, but these rules did not apply to fidepromissio. Both were obsolete
under Justinian, but the following points in which they differed from lide·
iussio may be noticed:
