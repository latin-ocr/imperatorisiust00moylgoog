EARLIER HIS T ORl' OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 615

the establishment oi a regular judicature3 the injured person, with
his kinsmen or dependents, made a loray against the wrongdoer‚ and
swept away his cattle, and with thern, perhaps, his wile and children,
or he threatened him with supernatural penalties by ‘fasting' upon
him, as in the East even at the present day; or, finally, he reduced
his adversary to servitude, or took his lile. The idea of such a
procedure was not compensation, but punishment; seli-tedress existed
not so much rei, as poenae persequendae causa¹: and as there is
no objective standard ol right and wrong, the measure ol the injury,
and therefore ol the punishment, is the feeling ol the injured person.
Traces ol this linger on in Roman Law throughout its whole history.
It has been observed¹ that in settling the damages to be awarded the
earliest administratore ol justice took as their guide the measure ol
vengeance likely to be exacted by an aggrieved person under the
circumstances ol the case’, and that this is the true explanation ol
the very different penalties imposed by ancient law on offenders
caught in the act, or soon aiter it, and on offenders detected alter
considerable delay. Even the later Roman law permitted the husband
to kill with impunity the adulterer taken flagrante delicto, and distin·
guished the guilt of the thiel according as he was caught in the act
or not ; the sur nocturnus was liable to the same penalty as the adul·
terer: lor certain bodily injuries (Gaius iii. 223) the Mosaic law ol
retaliation had its counterpart at Rome. And from the ‘addictio'
os the sur manifestus and the insolvent debtor, and the commonness
ol noxal surrender (Gaius iv. 75-79‚ Bk. iv. 8 supr.) in intemational no
less than in private relations, Ihering conjectures that a lorm ol sels-
redress especially favoured by usage was the seizure and detention
ol tbe person ol the wrongdoer, until he was ransomed by his friends,
or had earned by the sweat ol his brow his own liberation.

From a comparison oi the different communities in which we know
this system os seli-redress to have prevailed‚ or even to obtain at the
present day, it would seem that there are two alternative connecting
linhs, as it were, between it and the later remedial process of advanc-
ing civilization. The practice ol uncontrolled private vengeance, ex·
tending even to lile and limb, dwindles everywhere to one ol the
various lorms ol distraint3 the survival, as at Rome, of a limited right of
