Tit. 7.] DE DONA T IONIBUS. 225

secundum enumeratos in nostra constitutione modos. Est ett
aliud genus inter vivos donationum, quod veteribus quidem
prudentibus penitus erat incognitum, postea autem a iunioribus
divis principibus introductum est, quod ante nuptias vocabatur
et tacitam in se condicionem habebat, ut tunc ratum esset,
curn matrimonium fuerit insecutum: ideoque ante nuptias ap-
pellabatur, quod ante matrimonium efficiebatur et nusquam
post nuptias celebratas talis donatio procedebat. sedprimus

should be imperfect and revocable in whole or part eitherif they exceeded
a certain maximum, the amount of which is unknown, or unless both
ownership and possession of the thing given were conveyed in the ap·
propriate manner (mancipatio and traditio), fragm. Vat. 3¹0·3¹3· Being
a lex imperfecta, it did not avoid a gift which failed to satisfy both ot
these conditions, or impose a penalty on the donee: but the introduc-
tion of the exceptio legis Cinciae practically enabled donors to revoke
gitts which 'violated the statute at any moment prior to their decease
(‘ morte Cincia removetur’ fragm. Vat. 259 266). If one may argue from
the analogy of the lex Furia testamentaria, only twenty years later in dnte
(Tit. 22. pr. inf), the maximum fixed by the lex Cincin was one which two
hundred years afterwards must have seemed ridiculously small : it is not
improbable that after some while observation of the statutoryrequire·
ment as to form (conveyance) was allowed to atone for violation of the
rule as to amount, so that the latter became tacitly repenled by disuse:
the rareness of passages referring to tbe maximum seems to require some
such hypothesis.

To facilitate proof, it appears to have become common under the
empire to register gifts apud acta (fragm. Vat. 266 a, 268). Such registra·
tion was made compulsory for all gifts exceeding 200 solidi in value,
except those to personae exceptae lege Cincia, by Constantius Chlorus:
of this privilege even they were deprived by Constantine, Cod. Theod. 3.
5. 1, as later still they were of the other advantage they had enjoyed under
the old statute, viz. that gitts between them did not require conveyance
for their perfectiori (Cod. Theod. 8. 12. 5), which was allowed to survive
in favour only of parents and children. Justinian,ashe says here, enacted
that delivery should in no case be essential for the perfectiori of the gift,
and relieved gifts of more than aoo but less than 500 solidi from the
necessity of registration: where one exceeding that amount was un·
registered, the excess could not be claimed. The gifts to which he refers
as not requiring registration however large are gifts to and from the
emperor, those forming a dos so far as they can be construed as gifts to
the wife, and such as were made for the redemption of captives and
the rebuilding of houses fallen or otherwise destroyed, Cod. 8. 50. 343
