never all found together, usually followed ln much the same relative

laintitf.

p The Demonstrabo, when found in a formula, immediately follows
the appointment of the iudex, and contains the allegation of fact upon
which the plaintiff bases hIs claim. It invariably begins with ‘quod'
‘whereas ;' c. g. in Gaius iv. 39 ‘quod Aulus Agerius Numerio Ne-
gidio hominem vendidit 3’ or ⁸ apud Numerium Negidiurn hominem
deposuit) Occasionally the place of the demonstratiois taken bya
praescriptio (pro actore), and sometimes even the latter is prefixed to
or worked into the former; its use is confined to formulae upon
actions in which the plaintiff is entitled from the defendant to anumber
or variety of acts prima facie hanging together, but of which one only,
or at least not all, are claimed in the present action. By the prae-
scriptio, beginning ‘ea res agatur, let the present trial relate exclusively
to so and so,’ the plaintill reserved his right of action upon the other
acts, or those subsequently to fall due, which would otherwise have
been eonsumed; it being a presumption of Roman law (capable,
however, of being rebutted by the insertion ofa praescriptio in the
formula) that when a man instituted an aetion, it comprised all his
claims against the defendant, prospective no less than present, sofar
at least as they related to the present ground of action, and already
had at least a potential existence. Two examples are given by Gaius.
In the one, a man to whom an annuity is payable, say, every six
months, sues for a half year's instaltnent, using the praescriptio ‘ea
res agatur cuius rei dies fuit ς’ in the other, the purchaser of an estate, '
claimlng that it shall be conveyed to him by mancipation, reserves to
himself the n'ght of subsequently demanding its mere traditio hya
praescriptio in the form ‘ea res agatur de fundo mancipando'

The Intentio, which follows the Demonstratio if there be one,is the
part of the formula ‘qua actor desiderium suum concludit? in which '

the plaintiff either affirma the legal right which he claims against the ¹

defendant, or else states a fact or facts (ln which latter case there is never

ademonstratio) from which the right is to be inferred. It is easily to ,

render against confusing the Roman iudex with an English judge The formerwas

merelya private citizen, appointed by the praetor after amicable selection by the 2
· parties, to determine certain issues of law and fact in accordanoe with the evidence

laid before him. Towsrds the end of the republican period the office, which had
previously been thought an honour, came to be regarded as a burderu and this led
to the institution by Augustus of an ‘album iudicum selectorum,’ from whom the
judge had to be chosen, and who were compellahle to hear ceses sent to them hy
the praetor.
