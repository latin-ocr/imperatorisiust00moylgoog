Summa autem divisio interdictorum haec est, quod autl
prohibitoria sunt aut restitutoria aut exhibitoria prohi-
bitoria sunt, quibus vetat aliquid fieri, veluti vim sine vitio
possidenti, vel mortuum inferenti, quo ei ius erit inferendi, vel

With the disappearance of the formulary system this complicated
procedure necessarily passed away; its very complication depended on
the formula Justinian tells us himself (ξ 8 inf.) that in his day interdicis
(stricto sensu) were no longer issued: in the opening paragraph of the
Title he speaks of interdicts ‘seu actionibus quae pro his exercentur‚'
with which may be compared the Title of Dig. 43. 1 ‘de interdictis
sive extraordinariis actionibus quae pro his competunt? An interdict,
in his time, rnay fairly be described as the trial by ordinary action,
commenced in the ordinary way, of questions which in the formulary
period would have been tried in the complicated mode described by
Gaius, arrd more particularly of questions relating to possession-‘ inter-
dicta autem licet in extraordinariis iudiciis proprie locum non habent,
tamen ad exemplum eorum res agitur' Cod 8. 1. 3. The only features
of difference between thern and en ordinary action are to be explained
by supposing that the questions on which they lay were thought to
deserve a somewhat more summary trial than others: hence the

directions in the Code (e. g. 8. 1.’4; 8. 2. 33 8. 4 8 ; 11. 47. 14), to
judges to try interdicte with all possible despatch‚ and the rule that the
operation of a decision on the interdict unde vi (which may be taken
usutype of the rest) shall not be suspended by appeal; Cod. 7. 69

111 qualification of Justiniau's description of interdicts under the earlier
system as ‘fonnae atque conceptiones verborum‚’ it may be observed
that all orders ol the praetor, like the sententia of n iudex, Cod. 7. 44. 1,
had to be orally delivered, though the interdict, being as a rule extremely
precise and technical, was committed to a written form, breviculum
orpericulurn, apparently as early as Cicero (in Verrem iii. 79). There
may also be a reference 10 the tennination of interdicte (stricto sensu) in
a regular action instituted by formula (‘ concepta verba, id est per for·
mulas' Gaius iv. ³0)= cf. 6111111111.141,1)14.15.511.1;44737411.

The following sections are concemed in the main with possessory
interdicte. ln § 1 some are specified which relate to Public Low:
others protect personal freedom (interdictum ‘de homine 1100100111ιί-
bendo’ Dig. 43. 29), family rights (‘ de liberis exhibendis et ducendis’
Dig. 43. 30), and rights of property ί* de arboribus caedendis, de glande
legenda' Dig. 43. 27 and 28) ; and finally, some were designed to ‘sane-
tion ’ the praetors exercise of his own imperium: e. g. the interdicta ‘ne
uis fiat ei quiin possessionem missus erit’ Dig. 43. 4, fraudatoriuut,
possessorium Gaius iv. 145, and sertorium ih. 146t
