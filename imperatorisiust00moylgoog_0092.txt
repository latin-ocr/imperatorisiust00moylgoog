INTRODUCTION TO BOOK l.

Tus first two Titles ol this book are merely introductory, and allord
no clue to the principle on which it is intended to distribute the rules
ol the private code. Title r is derived in the main from the ‘Institu-
tions’ ol Ulpian; it contains definitions ol Justice and Jurisprudence,
determines the scope ol the work as a treatise on private law, and
draws the distinction between ius naturale, gentium, and civile, which
has been adverted to in the general introduction (p. 27 sq, supr). In
the second Title ius naturale is defined alter Ulpian, and then ius civile
aud ius gentium are distinguished in the words os Gaius, though, as
has been pointed out elsewhere, the latter contrast is the true and
important one, and in other parts oi the work ius gentium and ius
naturale are identified. The sources ol the positive law oi Rome arc
then specilied and each briefly described.

ln tkie opening words ol the third Title we meet with the significant

. statement ol the principle upon which the arrangement ol the Insti-

tutes is to proceed. That principle, and, accordingly, that arrange·
ment, is taken literally from Gaius, and an exposition ol its meaning
will be as important lor the work ol the jurist as lor that ol the prince.
‘The whole law by which we are governed relates either to persons
or to things, or to actions! The¹ division ol the Institutes into these
three departments is perlectly clear; the ‘ius quod ad personas
pertinet' occupies Bk. i. Title 3, to the end3 the ‘ius quod ad res'
extends from the beginning oi Bk. ii to Bk. iv. Title 53 the remainder
ol Bk iv ‘pertinet ad actiones? In this particular point the Gaian
distribution is more satisfactory, as it makes the break between res
and actiones at the end of the third commentary, and devores the
whole oi the lourth to the latter subject, in the Institutes the formal
division ol Books tends somewhat to obscure the material classifica-
tion oi the system. This, however, though ‘inelegans’ presents no
obstacle to our comprehension of the system itseli3 but we are at
once met by difficulties, and by great differences ol opinion among
the commentators, when we attempt to discover the meaning oi the
