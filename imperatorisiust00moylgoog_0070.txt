Under Constantine (an. 306-337) the constitution lost its last sern-
blance oi republican form, and assumed the character oi an open
despotism. The most important results oi this were amore rigid
concentration oi all executive authority, separation oi the civil and
military administrations, which had hitherto existed in close cont-
bination, and the institution os a graduated official hierarchy, witha
consequent division of ranks and dignities.¹ The distinctions ol con·
dition rest citheron an independent foundation or on the simple will
of the emperor. Ol the first kind are the old contrasts between cives,
Latini, and peregrini, between ingenui and libertini, and between men
ol unblemisbed civil reputation and insames3 also a new one be·

tween proprietors aod non-proprietors oi land. Oi the second kind ¹

are the patriciate, a new distinction devised hythe emperors as a
reward ior faithful service in the state or in the field, and the other
dignities oi the court and of the civil and military administration,
dignitates palatinae, civiles, militares. All oi these were arranged in
a fixed order of precedence, and differentiated irom one another by
terms of honour such as illustris, spectabilia, clarissimus. It would
be tedicus, however, to enter into a tull account oi these, though more
or less connected with the subject oi legislative power. Constantine's
three sons, Constantine 11, Constantius, and Constans (n. n. 3 36-361),
by their internal discords and the wealrness oi their efforts to sup-
press other pretenders to the throne, paxed the way to the linal
division of the empire into West and Euat, which took place under
Arcadius and Honorius, run. 395. For sonae generations the two
empires subsisted side by side with one another. From the com·
meucemeut oi the fitth century, however, the Germanic peoples began
to intrude themselves into the dominicus ol the Western Emperor,
aud their aggressibus became year by year more menacing, until, ’
aiter having long been a mere object oi baoty to the barbariam, the
Western empire was finally absorbed in their conquests an. 476.

From this briei notice of the political history we turn to amore ap· '

propriate subject, the condition oi the law in the period intervening
between Constantine and justinian. Ol the influences to. which must

be attributed the general character and tendency oi its development
oue is intimately connected with the division ol the empire into West
aud East. The jurists had raised the ius gentium to a level with the
ius civile, and had esteemed naturalis as poweriul a principle as civilis
