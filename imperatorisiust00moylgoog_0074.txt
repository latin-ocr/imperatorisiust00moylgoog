imperial council‚ or court of appeal, in which the majority of votes
had always won the day ; ‘when it had ceased to be usual to convolre
and consult living jurists‚ the practice was transferred to the councils
ol the dead’ So far the ‘law of Citations' creates no difficulty3 but

as to the effect of another passage there has been much diversity of
opinion. That passage runs as follows: ‘Papiniani Pauli, Gaii,
Ulpiani atque Modestini scripta universa firmamus, itaut Gaium, quae
Paulum, Ulpianum et cunctos comitetur auctoritas, lectionesque ex
omni eius opere recitentur. Eorum quoque scientiam, quorum trac·
tatus atque sententiae praedicti omnes suis operibus miscuerunt,
ratam esse censemus, ut Scaevolae, Sabini, Iuliani atque Marcelli,
omniumque quos illi celebrarunt, si umen eorum libri, propter an·
tiquitatis incertum, codicum collatione linnentur. Ubi autem diversae
sententiae proferuntur,’ etc. (Cod. Theod r. 4. 3). This is explained
by some writers¹ to mean (ι) that statutory force was hereby for the
first time given to the worlrs of Gaius, Papinian, Ulpian, Paulus, and
Modestinus, and to such opinions of other prudentes as were therein
cited; and (a) that all other juristic literature (including the notes of
Ulpian and Paulus on Papinian) was in future to have no validity
whatever. ll this interpretation is the true one, the view which has
been above stated, that the writings of authorized jurists had always
the statutory force enjoyed by their responsale clearly erroneous.
But the arguments against it are extremely strong. Though the
‘law of Citations' confirms the authority of the live leading jurists, it
is very far from expressly excluding the authority of others ; it men·
tions others, and clearly only exempli gratia, as representative of the
great mass of other juristic literature3 and the weight which it allows
to these others is not less, except in cases oi equality of voices, than
that ol the five. Secondly, it is to be observed that the worlrs of
other jurists are frequently cited as authorities by later emperors
(e. g. Julian by Leo and Anthemius in Cod. 6. 61. 53 hlarcian by
Justinian in Cod ¹1. 7. 13 Tertullian in Cod. 5. 70. 7). But the
strongest argument of all is to be found in the Constitutions issued by
Justinian with reference to the compilation of the Digest, in which he
instructa the compilers to maire excerpts from the authorized jurists,
and in the fact that, acting under this commission‚ they selected
thirty-nine writers, and inserted in the work passages from every one
of thern ς this they could not possibly have done if the only autho-
