INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV. 491

mels of law, and so much was left to the discretiori of the y'udge him·
self, that little could be said upon the matter: the litigant was no
longer liable to be wreclred by the omission of some slight form; the
administration of justice had become more ‘paternal,' and state offi-
cials saw that he duly went through many stages in the process (or
went through them for him) for which the earlier law had left him
solely responsible in person. Knowledge of Procedure was therefore
of less importance than in the old days, and what there was to lmow
could be learnt less satisfactorily from bools than by attending
the courts, to which Justinian himself refers the student (eg. Tit rr.
6). Hence it is impossible to give a really connected view of the
matters discussed in the last thirteen Titles of the Book which lies
before us. So far as there ever was a connection between them, it
is to be ascertained hy systematically reading the fourth Book of
Gaius, not that of his imitator.

ln the sirth Title Actions are divided upon three main principles.

i. According to their content they are divided (a) into real and
personal. A real action is one in which the plaintiff affirms a right
in rem, whether dominium (5 r) or a ius in re aliena (ξ a); in a
personal action his contentiori is that the defendant is under some
specific legal obligation to him, ‘Prejudicial’ actions, in which the
issue usually is a question of status, may be regarded as a species of
the former class: ln rem esse videntur, § 133 and some actions ‘mix-
tam causam obtinere videntur' (ξ ao), he. are at once both real and
persona13 these are the iudicia divisoria, such as suits for the partition
of an inheritance or other j0int property, and for the regulation of
boundaries. Cross divisions from this same point of view of content
are (b) that which tums upon the plaintifl's more immediate object,
according as it is to obtain mere reparation (actiones rei persecutoriae‚
517), as in real actions and those arising ex eontractu3 to merely
recover a penalty (poenae persecutoriae‚ ξ ι8), as in the actio furti;
orto get compensation and penalty in one (actiones mixtae, ξ 19),
as in the actions on robbery and under the lex Aquilia, (c) according
to the amount of damages recovered, which may he simple (e. g.
actions on contract, ξ aa), double (e. g. the actio furti nec manifesti,
ξ 23), triple (ξ 24) or quadruple (eg. the aetio furti manifesti, ξ 25);
(d) that which depends upon the possibility of the plaintlfl's being
unable to recover the whole of what is his strict legal due (ξ 36),
owing to the defendant's liahility being mere partial or conditional on
his means: examples of these are given in §f 3⁶·40·

ii. Actions are called legitimae or civiles if accorded by the civil
