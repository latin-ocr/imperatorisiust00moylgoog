right and ought to be done. Now the peoples ol' whom the empire
was composed were so diverse that they had but one characteristic
in common, viz. that they were not Romans. They could have no
common legal habit as a nation, and thus could generate no new
positive customary law save merely local rules; the only intluence
they could unite to exercise was a negative one, to abandon all such
portions ol the system as were purely arrd exclusively Roman. And
this destructive work, as we have seen, they did do. So with the
other sources os the ius scriptum which are enumerated in the
institutes (i. a. 3). Leges proper, plebiscita, and senatusconsulta,
as we know, bad long been obsolete; and by the ordinance cited a
lew lines above, Constantine laad given the last blow to the edicta
magistratuum. Still, the development oi law might have been carried
on, as it had been from Augustus to Maximian, by the responsa
prudentium and systematic treaties ol authorized jurists; but we look
in vain for these forms of legal activity, sor true jurisprudence had
already died a namrat death. The juristic literature of the period
now under consideration consiste merely ol compilations lrom statutes
or constitutions and lrom the writings oi earlier prudentes. Theodo-
sius Il (ao. 408-450) attests the cessation ol true juristic work in
the enactment by which he promulgated his codex constitutionum:
‘saepe nostra clementia dubitavit, quae causa laceret, ut tantis pro·
positis praemiis, quibus artes et studia nutriuntur, tarn pauci raroque
extiterint, qui plena iuris civilis scientia ditarentur, et in tanto lrrcu·
brationum tristi pallore vix unus aut alter receperit soliditatem per-
fectae doctrinae! His own explanation ol the phenomenon is the
vast multipiicity ol imperial ordinances and juristic books without an
adequate study oi which a knowledge ol the law was impossible; and
tbe hope is expressed that a remedy for this will be afforded by the
comparatively small dimensione ol lais own compilation.

Direct imperial legislation thus remained the only sorm in which
changes could be ellected in positive law. What Justinian says in
Cod 1.14.1a is true ol the whole period extending backward from
himself to Constantine: ‘ln praesenti leges condere soli imperatori
concessum est, et leges interpretari solum dignum imperio esse
oportet ;’ and this will account sor the ever-increasing activity ol the
imperial legislation. In the interval ol130 years between Constan-
tine and Theodosius 11 the mass ol general constitutions had already
become so great that the latter emperor's compilation formed a book
ol very considerable dimensions, and yet in this much was curtailed,
still more omitted ς ior instance, it contained none of the enactments
