Tit.19.] DE INUTILIBUS S Τ IPULA T IONIBUS. 405

sariam inducere emendationem, ut, sive post mortem sive
pridie quam morietur stipulator sive promissor stipulatio
concepta est, valeat stipulatio. Item si quis ita stipulatus 14
erat: ‘si navis ex Asia venerit, hodie dare spondesi' inutilis
erat stipulatio, quia praepostere concepta est. sed cum Leo
inclitae recordationis in dotibus eandem stipulationem quae
praepostera nuncupatur non esse reiciendam existimavit,
nobis placuit et huic perfectum robur accommodare, ut non
solum in dotibus, sed etiam in omnibus valeat huiusmodi
conceptio stipulationis. Ita autem concepta stipulatio, veluti 15
si Titius dicat ‘cum moriar, dare spondes?’ vel ‘cum mo-

one in favour of one’s heir, who is no party to the contram, and for that
reason was held invalid; see references on ξ 4 supr. Justinian's change
enabled the obligatio and actio ‘a persona heredis incipere’ Cod. 4. 11 ;
hence if the deceased stipulated for payment to one of his heirs only,
that one alone was benefited; which previously had not been always the
case even where he had stipulated for himself and the particular heir,
which was perfectly allowable (see note last referred to), ‘quod dari sti·
pulemur, non posse per nos uni ex heredibus adquiri, sed necesse est,
omnibus adquiri: at cum quid fieri stipulamur, etiam unius personam
recte comprehendi' Dig. 45. 1. r 37. 8.

The repugnance to allowing an obligation ‘apersona heredis incipere,’
Gaius iii. roo (as where A promises B something aster his (A’s) death)
was perhaps partially due, as is suggested by lhering‚ to a desire to
prevent evasions of such statutes as the leges Falcidia, Iulia, and Papia
Poppaea ; see Mr. Poste's note on the passage of Gaius referred to.

t 14. By Justinian's enactment, Cod. 6. 23· 2 5, the promise in this so-
called praepostera stipulatio became binding at once, but could nothe
sued upon until after the fulhlment of the condition: ‘reprehensionem
quam novella constitutio (sc. Leonis) in dotalibus instrumentis sustulisse
noscitur, in aliis quoque omnibus tam contractibus quam testamentis tol·
limus, ut tali exceptione cessante et stipulatio et alii contractus et testa·
toris voluntas indubitate valeat, exactione videlicet post condicionem vel
diem competente.¹ lt is difficult to say whether under this enactment a
promisor who paid before the fulfilment of the condition could recover by
condictio indebiti after the condition had failed; see on Tit. ις. 4 supr, ⁰

§ 15. The reason whya stipulation in the form ‘ cum moriar (orcum
morieris) dari spondes ?³ had been valid under the old law, as stated by
Gaius, iii. 100, was that the obligation was held to entitle the promisee,
or bind the promisor, ‘in novissimo vitae suae tempore‚’ and not ‘a per·
sona heredis incipere’ One might have thought that the reason why
one in the form ‘pridie quam moriar’ was void (‘ quia non potest aliter
intellegi pridie quam aliquis morietur quam si mors secuta sit’ Gaius
t c.) would have applied equally well here: Gaius himself was sensible
