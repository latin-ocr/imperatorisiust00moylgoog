Tit.5.] DE LIBERTINIS. 109

antiqui iuris altercationes placavimus: Latinos autem lunianos
et omnem quae circa eos suerit observantiam alia constitutione
per eiusdem quaestoris suggestionem correximus, quae inter
imperiales radiat sanctiones, et omnes libertos nullo nec aetatis
manumissi nec dominii manumissoris nec in manumissionis
modo discrimine habito, sicuti antea observabatur, civitate
Romana donavimus: multis additis modis, per quos possit
libertas servis cum civitate Romana, quae sola inpraesenti
est, praestari.

solenniter' the rights os Latinitas (General Introd. p. 26 supr), whence
they were called Latini Iuniani. The Latinitas ol the latini coloniarii
had conferred the commercium without the connubium, i. e. the power
ol holding property and engaging in commerce under the peculiar forms
and protection oi Roman law, and ol making a testament valid iure
civili. But these rights were seriously curtailed, in the case os Latini
luniani, by the lex lunia Norbana, which (Gaius i. 22-24 Ulpian, reg.
ao. 8) deprived them of the privileges os making a will, being named
testamentary guardians, and benefiting under the will of another person.
Consequently, when a Latinus Iunianus died, as he could have no suus
heres or agnete, his whole property went ‘iure quodammodo peculii' to
his patron; Bk. iii. 7. 4 inl. Justinian repealed the lex lunia, and as to
the modes oi manumission to which it had related, he enacted that they
should make a slave a lull citizen provided they were evidenced hy five
witnesses; Cod. 7. 6. The alii multi modi alluded to in ξ 1 are specified
in the same constitution : among them are the formal designation oi the
slave by the master as his son, and the delivery to him of the docu-
ments by which his servitude could be proved. There were numerous
modes in which a Latinus could attain the civitas ; see Gaius i. 28-35, and
hir. Poste’s notes.

The object oi the lex Aelia Sentia (Α. D. 4) was to throw obstacles in
the way oi inconsiderate manumissions, and to guard the state against
the dangers which might result from the bestowal os citizenship on
slaves oi bad character and antecedents3 it should thus be read in
close connection with the lex Fufia Caninia, Tit. 7 inf. Four ol its pro-
visions concern us. (r) It enacted that slaves who had been guilty oi
some serious crime, or subjected to some degrading treatment, ii subse·
quently manumitted, should bave only the same rights as dediticii, or
memies surrendered at discretiori : ‘lege itaque Aelia Sentia cavetur, ut
qni servi a dominis poenae nomine vincti sint, quibusve stigmata in·
scripta sint, deve quibus ob noxam quaestio tormentis habita sit, et in
ea noxa fuisse convicti sint, quique ut ferro aut cum bestiis depugnarent
traditi sint, inve· ludum custodiamve coniecti fuerint, et postea vel ab
eodem domino vel ab alio manumissi, eiusdem conditionis liberi fiant,
cuius conditionis sunt peregrini dediticii' Gaius i. 13. They could not

by any possibility rise to the status oi cives or even oi Latini ; the statute
