difficulties of the calendar, upon whose distinctions of dies fasti and
dies nefasti the successful issue of an action so much depended.
These mysteries were somewhat simplified by Cn. Flavius, who, as
aedile (circ. 3¹² a. ci, for the first time published a calendar, in which

dies fasti and dics nefasti were distinguished, the people being thus
enabled to know the days on which they could aud those on which
they could not perform public acts, and who also made a compilation
of formulae required in the legis actiones and in the due performance
of solemn dispositions: ‘postea cum Appius Claudius proposuisset et
ad formam redegisset has actiones, Cn. Flavius, scriba eius, libertini
filius, subreptum libmm populo tradidit, et adeo gratum fuit id munus
populo, ut tribunus plebis fieret, et senator et aedilis curulis. Hic
liber, qui actiones continet, appellatur ius civile Flavianum, sicut ille
ius civile Papirianum nam nec Cn. Flavius de suo quidquam adiecit
libro. Augescente civitate, quia deerant quaedam genera agendi, non
post multum temporis spatium Sextus Aelius alias actiones composuit,
et librum populo dedit, qui appellatur ius Aelianum’ (Pomponius in
Digna. a. y). The mode in which the early prudentes acquired
their knowledge was by attending as auditores, while young, an ex-
perieuced jtuiseonsult in the practica] worlt of his profession, and
by a careful smdy of the Twelve Tables aud such other books on the
subjectas were available. Among these may be mentioned those ol
Cn. Flavius aud S. Aelius, alluded to in the passage just cited from
Pomponius, and worits by the Catos, P. Mucius, Brutus, and Manilius.
Of systematic teaching in schools or lecture-rooms there is as yet no
ttace. The influeuce of the jurists on the law in this earliest period .
isof a very definite character, and is expressed by the term ‘inter-
pretatio,' by which should be understood the completion or supple-
menting of the written out of the uuwritteu law3 not in the sense that
they were strictly tied by the letter of the statute, or by the express
words of the lawgivet, but that they were guided by its spirit, bya
conception of law as a living and growing organism, and by a
realisatiou of the necessity of adapting it to the growing require-
meuts of an advaucing civilisation. lt was thenon the Twelve
Tables aud succeediug statutes that this ‘interpretatio' was to bear3
and its operation may be illustrated by an example. The Twelve
Tables had given au action against the owner of a quadruped which
caused a damnum ; as cases occurred in which damage was done by
twofooted auimais in the same way as the statute had contemplated‚
it was iuferrcd that to grant an action here too was required by its
spirit, the action was accordingly introduced, and brought as under
