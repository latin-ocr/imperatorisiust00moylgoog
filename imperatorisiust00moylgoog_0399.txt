as when delivered to him, unless its deterioration is due to causes not
within the ken of that degree of diligence which he is bound to show,
Dig. 16. 3. 1. 16, (3) to restore it (and any fruits it may have borne while
in his custody‚ Dig. 22. 1. 38. ιο) on demand: even if a time was agreed
upon for its return, he must give it up before if required Cod. 4. 34. 11.
pr., Dig. 16. 3. t. 11. 'ibe obligation to return a depositum was abso·
lute: so that even if the depositary alleged that it belonged to him, he
must first give it up, arrd then might claim the dominium by real action,
Cod. 4. 34. rr. Lastly, (4) he might not use the depositum: such use
without the depositor’s consent amounted to theft, Ba iv. 1. 6 inf, unless
made bona fide, in which case he must give up all profit which bad
accrued to him thereby‚ Cod. 4. 34. 4

The same duties might be incurred ex post facto by the depositor as
by the commodator, bur he was required to show a higher degree of dili·
gentia, the contract being in his interest alone: the depositarius, however,
could enforce them only by actio depositi (contraria), not by retentio or
lien, Cod 4 34 11. A peculiarity of the actio depositi directa was that
in it no compensatio or set off by the defendant was allowed, Bk. iv. (a 30
inf.

lf the deposit was occasioned by pressing and irresistible necessity,
eg. by tumultus, incendium, ruina, or naufragium-the liability of the
depositarius was doubled in respect of damages: this is usually called
depositum miserabile: ‘de eo, quod tumultus, incendii, ruinae, naufragii
causa depositum est, in heredem de dolo mortui actio est pro hereditaria
portione et in simplum et intra annum quoque: in ipsum et in solidum
et in duplum et in perpetuum datur' Dig. 16. 3. 18: cf. Blr. iv. 6. 17 and
23 inf. 'ibe liability had always been in duplum when the deposit was
made by fiducia: in other words, a denial of the trust was treated as a
furtum nec manifestum. When the praetor made a violatiou of the
duties incurred by mere acceptance of detention actionable, he reduced
the damages by one half : ‘ex causa depositi lege duodecim tabularum in
duplum actio datur, edicto praetoris in simplum’ Paul sent. rec. 2. 12. 11.

Two varieties of contract are sequestration and the so-called depositum
irregulare. The first is the deposit of property by two or more persons
in order to withdraw it from the disposition of both or all, especially where
the title to it is in dispute: here the depositarius, or, as he was specifi-
cally called, sequester, might by special arrangement have civil possession
(p. 32 3 supr.) in order to prevent acquisition of the object per usucapionem
by any of the claimants, Dig. 16. 3. 6. Depositum irregulare exists where
a res fungibilis is deposited with the agreement that the depositary shall
become its owner, and only be bound to return a similar quantity and
quality. The periculum rei rests with him ς ie if it is accidentally de·
stroyed, lost, or stolen, he alone suffers ; but he has the right to use it.
The transaction differs from mutuum, which it so closely resembles, in
