the actions which they brought for the establishment of their claims, and
by whom the assets were sold in lots; the proceeds of the sale were
distributed by the judge among the creditors, in a detenninate order of
priority (for which see Poste’s Gaius p. 3 52). Property which the insol-
vent might subsequently acquire remained liable to successise sales, until
the creditors had been paid in full.

Embarrassed debtors could also usually avail them⁵elves of a pro·
cedure more in the nature of a voluntary composition with creditum,
called cessio bonorum (Bk. iii. 2 5. 83 iv. 6. 403 ib. 14 4 int), which was
introduced by a lex Iulia of one of the two first Caesars. By adopting
this course they escaped liability to arrest and imprisonment, Cod. 7. 71.
1, which bankrupts proper might still incurii the missio in bona produced
no results ; a debtor could be committed to prison at tire outset only on
the application of the Treasury. Further, they did not become infames,
like banlrrupts‚ Cod. 2. 12. 2, and were allowed to retain so much of their
after-acquired property as was necessary for their subsistence (beneficium
competentiae, see on Blc iv. 6. 37 inf), Dig. 42. 3. 4, Cod 7. 71. r. No
debtor‚ however, could claim to make a cessio bonorum whose insol·
vency was due to his own fault, Cod. 7. 71. 8. pr. The procedure after
the surrender seems in all essential points to have been the same as in
banknrptcy.

A mode of universal succession described by Gaius (iii. 8 5-87), but not
alluded to by Justinian, as being obsolete in his day, is in iure cessio of
an heredit as by an agnate entitled on intestacy‚ for which see p. 2 56 supr.
lt seems improper to regard this as a universal successim, for what the
agnate transferred was, not the hereditas, but the single right of becoming
heres to a succession as yet only delata
