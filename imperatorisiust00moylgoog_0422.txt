§22 For a man to stipulate sor conveyance to him, when he has
become its owner, oi property which will be his hereafter, is the same

§28. The two chief varieties of mistake have been distinguished on
Bk. ii. 20. 29 supr. To say oi contracts that they are void by reason ol
mistake in the expression of intention is incorrect: they are void, if at
all, because one states that one intends what one does not really intend,
though it is true that, had it not been lor a mistake, this statement would
never have been made. lt is not, however, enough to nullify a disposition
that a mistake has caused a declaration which was not really intended:
the expressed intention must have been unintended either altogether, or
at least in an essential portion : and this is the true meaning os the dic·
tum that ‘essential error alone is a ground ol nullity! By essential error,
in this sense, is to be understood error as to either (a) the nature of the
legal relation or right to be produced: ‘non satis autem est dantis esse
nummos et fieri accipientis, ut obligatio nascatur, sed etiam hoc animo
dari et accipi, ut obligatio constituatur; itaque si quis pecuniam suam
donandi causa dederit mihi, quamquam et donantis luerit et mea fiat,
tamen non obligabor ei, quia non hoc internos actum est' Dig. 44. 7. 3.

vided this is material, Dig. 28. 5. 9. pr.: or (c) the thing in relation to
which the intention is declared (e. g. the text before us, and Dig. 28. 5. 9.
1; 30. 4. pr.; 45. 1. 137.1: or (d) the properties, i. e. quality, of that
thing ; as to which the rule extracted by Savigny in respect oi sale from
the cases is that ‘the error avoids the contract when the difference in
quality between the thing bought, and that which the purchaser intended
to buy, is such, according to commercial usage, as to put the one in a
different category os merchandise lor the other,’ System ἕξ 137, 138: for
