on to their opponents. To prevent this the lormer could either bring

condictio ob causam datorum, compelling the holders to prove the
alleged consideration, or in delault to deliver up the memoranda (coa
4. 30. 7), or protest in the acta ol a court against their validity, or
make their exceptio perpetual by serving a sormal written notice on
the creditor, Cod ib. 14. 4.

Justinian, before whose legislation the exceptio pecuniae non
numeratae could be used only where delault had been made in the
advanee ol money by the plaintiff, gave it a larger scope by allowing
it also where the alleged consideration was the conveyance ol other
things: ‘in contractibus, in quibus pecuniae vel aliae res numeratae
vel datae esse conscribuntur, non intra quinquennium, quod antea con·
stitutum erat, non numeratae pecuniae obicere possit, qui accepisse
pecunias vel alias res scriptus sit, vel successor eius, sed intra solum
biennium continuum' Cod. 4. 30. 4. pr. Justinian's attempt to pass
off the ‘cautio' as a ‘literal' contract, which is due merely to the
habit ol reproducing‚ il possible, the arrangement and terminology ol
Gaius, is forced and unhappy: the notion ol an obligation arising
simply literis does not appear elsewhere in the Corpus iuris, except
solatas the use of scriptura and literae in Dig. 44. 7. a. 1; ib. 38,
and 46. a. ι’] may be regarded as a reminiscente ol the old ex·
pensilatio.
