adopted in Book iii. Title ro. Ownership and iura in re aliena are
comprised in Book it Titles r to 93 possession is touched upon in·
cidentally only, in connection with usucapion (Book ii. Title 6) and
interdicte (Book iv. Titie 15). obligations, under the heads of con·

Title13 to Book iv. Titie 53 and inheritance‚ testate and intestate,
with the cognate topics of legacy and fidei commissum, is the subject
of Book ii. Title ro to Book iii. Titie 9. The consideration of the
arrangement adopted by Justinian himself after Gaius is reserved for
the introductions to the separate books, in which too the reader's
attention will be called to the chief particulare in which the law of
Justinian had advanced upon that of Gaius, or in which the rules
stated by the latter had become obsolete, and thus 3 mere matter
of antiquarian learning, in the age of the former.

Τ113 Institutes were published on Nov. ar, nn. 533, with statutory
force, along with the Digest, from Dec. goth of the same year. At the
same time Justinian fixed the system of study to be in future followed in
the public schools of law. The course was to occupy five years. The
first was to be devoted to the Institutes and the first four books (spera)
of the Digest ; the second, to the parts of the latter relating to iudicia
aud res creditae (Books 5-19)‚ and also to certain portioris of later
books dealing with the proprietary relations of husband and wife,
guardian and ward, and testamenta and legacies. In the third year
Books 20-22 of the Digest were to be studies, 3ηά also certain por·
tions to be gone over again which had been already read in the pre-
ceding year. These were to be followed, in the fourth year, by the
parts of Books 20-36 which had aot already engaged the student's
attention. The subjecta prescribed for the last year of the course
were Books 37-50 of the Digest, and the Code; these were read
privately, so that the subject-matter os the professorlal lectures, which
spread themselves over the first four years, was the Institutes and the
first thirty-six books of the Digest.

Justinian's design had been to embrace in his three authoritative
works every jot and tittle of positive law. It was transparent, however,
as things stood at the end of nn. 533, that this object had not been
fully attained. The Digest and the Institutes, from the point of view of
the legal reforrner of that epoch, left little to be desired; but it was at
once perceived that the Code of nu. 529 was far from complete ; the
great majority of Justinian's own constitutions had been issued subse-
quently to its promulgation, and Tribonian‚ who had not been president,
but merely an ordinary member of the commission which had compiled
