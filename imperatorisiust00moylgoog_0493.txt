THE ROMAN LITERAL CONTRACT AND ITS HISTORII.

Trrs true old Roman litersl contract, or expensilatio, which appar·
ently began to be disused soon atter the tall oi the Republic,
was concluded by the creditor’s making, with the debtor's assent, an
entry in bIs domestic account-boot or ledger (codex, tabulae) oi so
much as advanced by blm to the latter (expensum ferre), the transsc-
tion thus appearing as aloen actual or fictitIous. Such a written
entry was not mere evidence of a contract binding on some other
ground-res, verba, or consensus: by itsels it laid the debtor under a
legal obligatior to repay the sum in question: ‘in nominibus alius
expensumferendo obligat' Galus iii. 137. There arc at least two
passages (Cic. ad Att 4. ep. 18, Valerius Maximus 8. a. α) which
prove that expensilatio was a mode oi creating a new and origInal
obligation. But it seems most ordiuarily tn have been employed lor
tbe purpose oi novation (Bk. iii. 29· 3), when it was called transcrip
tio, and the entry ‘nomen transcripticium’ Gaius iii. 128: sud in the
form transcriptis a persona in personam (ί veluti si id quod mibi Titius
debet, tibi id expensum tulero' Gaius loe cit), it must among business
men bave been os great value in the simplification end seulement ol
outstanding accounts The main object of transcriptio seems to have
been the substitution ol a strict civil law sor a iuris gentium contram
or, as Mr. Poste puts its, ‘to metamorphose claime recoverable by
actions ex fide bona, e. g. locati conducti, empti venditi, which in many
'points favourcd the defendentium debts recoverable by the short and
sharp remedy ol the civil action ol condicti0, which, when brought ior
certa pecunia credita, was the more lormidable to a disbonest liti-
gant, as it was accompanied by a sponsio poenalis, whereby the tun·
quished party soricited a third ol the sum ln litigatIon, in additionis
he was the defendant, to the original claim! Tbat this wss its main
use seems more than probable⁸ on apnbrs' grounds, for it is clear tint
