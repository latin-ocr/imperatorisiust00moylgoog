actiones, quarum mentionem habuimus, et si quae sunt similes,
ex legitimis et civilibus causis descendunt. aliae autem sunt,
quas praetor ex sua iurisdictione comparatas habet tam in
rem quam in personam, quas et ipsas necessarium est exemplis
ostendere. ecce plerumque ita permittit in rem agere, ut vel

actor diceret se quasi usu cepisse, quod usu non ceperit, vel ex

relate see Bk. ii. 3-5 and notes supr. 'ibe actio confessoria, affirming
a right of servitude in the plaintiff, lay not only against the dominus of

the res serviens, but against any one by whom the right was violated, and

its objects were recognition of the right and damages forits infringe·
ment: in form it was arbitraria (§ 31 inf). ln many cases, especially of
praedia} servitudes, the person entitled was not limited to this remedy,
but could use an interdict, and thereby compel the dominus, if he wished
to contest the right, to bring the actio negatoria By this he asserted
the freedom of his property from the servitude affirmed by the other; its
object being restoration of the property itself (if the other claimed a use
or usufruct) or cessation of the act by which the rights of ownership had
been interfered with 3 damages for what had been done, and security by
stipulation against its repetition. For these actions generally cf. Mr.
Poste’s note on Gaius iv. 3.

' The single case referred to at the end of the semion, in which a
possessor can be plaintiff in a real action, and of which Justinian says
fuller information may be found in the Digest, may be either where a
person, though not ceasing to ‘possess’ his property, has given it as
precarium to another, Dig. 43. 26. 15. 4: or where one person possesses
ex iusta causa (ie. as dominus) and another vi aut clam, but not from
him (so that the interdict Uti possidetis does not lie), Dig. 43. 17. 3. pr.;
or where a civil possessor brings vindicatio against another who has
detention in his name, Dig. 6. 1. 9 3 7. 9. 7. pr.

§3. For the history of the distinction here drawn between actiones
civiles or legitimae, and actiones honorariae (the latter comprising the
two classes of utiles and in factum) see Excursus X. Actiones honorariae
in rem are exemplified in §§ 3-7, in personam in ἑξ 8-12 inf.

By possessor at the end of this section can only be meant ‘is qui olim
possederat' (referring to § 5 inf), cf. domino for ‘ei qui dominus fuerat'
int 5, and Dig.41. 1. 56. 1 ; 27. 3. 13. 4.
