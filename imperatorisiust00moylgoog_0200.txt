Tit. r.] DE RERUM DIVISJONE. 185

Nullius autem sunt res sacrae et religiosae et sanetae: quod
enim divini iuris est, id nullius in bonis est. Sacra sunt, quae 7
rite et per pontifices deo consecrata sunt, veluti aedes sacrae8
et dona, quae rite ad ministerium dei dedicata sunt, quae
etiam per nostram constitutionem alienari et obligari pro·
bibuirnus‚ excepta causa redemptionis captivorum. si quis
vero auctoritate sua quasi sacrorn sibi constituerit, sacrum
non est, sed profanum. locus autem, in quo sacrae aedes
aedificatae sunt, etiarn diruto aedificio adhuc sacer manet,
utet Papinianus scripsit Religionum locum unusquisque9

posed: so that legal relations can' subsist between it and them and any
number oi them no less than between it and other persons generally.
Such corporations may be exemplified by the state (Dig. 49. 14, Cod.
ro. r), ecclesiastical bodies (Dig. 28. 3. 6. 7), and commercist associatione,
‘collegia pistorum, fabrorum,’ etc. (Dig. 3. 4 r. pr.)

Universitates bonorum are juristic persons not necessarily supported
by any natural person: they are so much property, or masses ol rights
and dones (Giiterinbegrill) personihed and regarded as capable ol per-
petuating their separate existence and fictitious unity indefinitely‚ eg.
the treasury orfiscus: inundatione such as churches, hospitals, and
almshouses : hereditates iacenteS, i.e. inheritances on which no heir has
yet entered, and tbe ‘estate’ or universitas iuris ol a citizen lying 'tn cap·
tirity with the enemy, Dig. 3. 5. ¹9· ς. Savigny’s dictum as to the origin
οἱ corporations (which is stated by Mr. Poste, Gaius p.156) seems
untme in the sace uf Dig, 34. 5. 20, born which it may be argued that
persons could always incorporate themselves for lawsul purposes without
the special assent oi the sovereign.

ξ’ῖ. When it is said that res sacrae, religiosae, and sanctae are res

. nullius, what is meant is rather that they were nullius inbonis, i.e. extra
patrimonium Res nullius, in the more technical sense, are those things
which ‘fiunt singulorum' by oocupatio, §§ 12-18 inf.

§⁸- Res sacrae could become so only by being dedicated under
public authority by a priestly ceremony (for which in the pagan time see
Cic. pru domo 47, ovid, Fast. 1. 610, Valet. Max. 5.10) in the later
period the imperial sanction seems to bave been sufficient, Dig. 5. 3.
50.1; 11. 7. 8. pr. By consecration they ceased to be in commercio and
became inalienable, though in Justinian’s time moveable res sacrae
might be sold for the purpose mentioned in the text (ef. Gregor. ep.
h 13, Socrates, trist. eccl 7. 21) end also ior the support nithe poor
in time of smine, and ior payment of the debts od the church, Cod.
1. 2. 21, Nor. rau 10. lf sacred ground was captured bytho enemy, it
hemme profanum, though by a ltind os postliminium it could recover its
former character, Dig. 11. 7. 3'6t

ξ.. Gaius (ii. 4) describes res religiosae as things ‘quae dis matribus
