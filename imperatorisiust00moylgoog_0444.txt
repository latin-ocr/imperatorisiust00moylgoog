DE SOCIETATE.

Societatem coire solemus aut totorum bonorum, quam
Graeci specialiter κοινοπραξίαν appellant, aut unius alicuius
negotiationis, veluti mancipiorum emendorum vendendor-

In locatio conductio rerum et operarum, 11 the hiring was 101110
specific time, either party could terminate the contract by notice 01 the
length prescribed by local or commercial usage. 11 the conductor rei
continued to nse the thing, with the other’s assent, alter the time agreed
upon had expired, a new contract was understood to have been made
(relocatio tacita) ; 11 the res was agricultural land, 101 a year (Cod. 4. 65.
13. 11), 11 anything else, and the original agreement was in writing, 101
the term therein specilied; 11 1101,101 the time during which the con-
ductor actually used the thing.

'Plu XXV. Before distinguishing the different forms which a pannea·
ship might assume, two limitations should be noticed which the contract
might not transgress. No person could even by express agreement
deprive himself 01 the n‘ght, noticed in §4 1111, 01 withdrawing from a
parmership when be pleased ; in other words, there could be 110 societas
in aeternum ‘in societate nemo compelliturinvitus detineri' Cod. 3. 37. 5.
Secondly, the purpose lor which the contract was formed must be neither
unlawful nor immoral : ‘ generaliter traditur, rerum inhonestarum nullam
esse societatem' Dig. 17. 2. 57.

Α fuller classilication 01 the species 01 partnership is given in Dig. 17.
2. 3, via:

(1) Societas omnium bonorum, in which all that previously belonged
10 the socii in severalty becomes their joint property by the mere making
011110 contract (see 011 Bk. ii. 1. 40 supr.),as well as everything which any 01
thern may subsequently acquire : ‘in societate omniurn bonorum omnes
res, quae coeuntium sunt, continuo communicantur, quia, lieet specialiter
traditio non interveniat, tacita 11111011 creditur intervenisse ; ea vero, quaa
in nominibus sunt, manent in suo statu, sed actiones invicem praestari
debent’ Dig. 17. 2. 1-3. This rule does not hold in 1110 remaining kinds
01 societas. Debts contracted by one 01 the partners, whether before or
during the partnership, can be claimed out 01 the joint property, Dig. ib.
27, which, however, is not liable 101 damages incurred 011 delicto unless ir
has to the knowledge 01 the partners been augmented from the proceeds
011110 wrong, ib. 51. 18.

(1) Societas universorum quae ex quaestu veniunt, or ordinary com·
mercial pannership, which, in the absence 01 express agreement, was
, presumed 10 bathe transaction intended hythe parties. Gains derived
110111 gift, legacy, or inheritance vere not included under quaestus, Dig.
17. 2. 7-13.

(3) Societas negotiationis alicuius, agreement 101 the joint conduct 01
