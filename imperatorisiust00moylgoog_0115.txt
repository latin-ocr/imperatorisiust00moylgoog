Ico INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. 1.

10 imitantur. Et non ineleganter in duas species ius civile
distributum videtur. nam origo eius ab institutis duarum
civitatium, Athenarum scilicet et Lacedaemonis, fluxisse
videtur: in his enim civitatibus ita agi solitum erat, ut Lace·
daemonii quidem magis ea, quae pro legibus observarent,
memoriae mandarent, Athenienses vero ea, quaein legibus
scripta reprehendissent, custodirent.

ll Sed naturalia quidem iura, quae apud omnes gentes ⁸
peraeque servantur, divina quadam providentia constituta
semper firma atque immutabilia permanent: ea vero, quae
ipsa sibi quaeque civitas constituit, saepe mutari solent vel
tacito consensu populi vel alia postea lege lata.

ir the uniformity of action is merely accidental, and not due to common
consciousness osa rule, it is unreasonable and unfit to be law.

Tbe principle thus precedes and generates the usage; but the older
view contains a certain trutb, viz. that the principle first acquires practical
validlty through the usage ot' which it is the parent, exactly as ius scriptum
acquires binding force through publication; and to this extent one can
say with truth, that as a statute comes into existence through publication,
so customary law comes into existence through usage or eustom. Savigny
also granta that in some cases the rule is actually begotten of the usage ;
in particular, where the substance oi the rule is more or less immaterial,
so longas the rule is there (eg. fixing of legal periods, forms, etc). On
the whole subject see Holland's Jurisprudence chap, v.

ξ 11. lt is clearly said here that a statute may in effect be abrogated by
a contrary custom: cf. ‘legibus istis situ atque senio obliteratis’ Gell. ii.
24, Plautus, Trinum. iv. 3. 30. 33, Livy 27. 8, and the strong expression
olJulian in Dig. 1. 3. 32. r ‘Quare rectissime illud receptum est, ut leges
non solum suffragio legislatoris, sed etiam tacito consensu omnium per
desuetudinem abrogentur.’ The very contrary seems to he maintained
in a passage already cited in part (Cod. 8. 53. 2) ‘consuetudinis usus·
que non vilis auctoritas est, sednon usque adeo suo valitura momento ut
rationem vincat aut legem? Perhaps the simplest way out ol the diffi-
culty is to suppose that the latter passage refers to a statute in which it
is expressly provided that in no case shall it be taken to be repealed bya
contrary custom of later development. Now ir approved custom ‘legis
vicem sustinet’ such a provision is absurd, and resembles the well·
known rule privilegia ne irroganto in assuming that a sovereign is capable
ot being legally bound. The question was submitted to the Emperor
