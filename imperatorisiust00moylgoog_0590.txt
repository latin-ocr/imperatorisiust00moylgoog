Tigra] DE PERPETUIS ΕΤ TEMPORALJBUS,ETC. 575

in heredem non competere, veluti furti, vi bonorum raptorum,
iniuriarum, damni iniuriae. sed heredibus huiusmodi actiones
competunt nec denegantur, excepta iniuriarum actione etsi
qua alia similis inveniatur. aliquando tamen etiam ex con-
tractu actio contra heredem non competit, eum testator dolose
versatus sit et ad heredem eius nihil ex eo dolo pervenerit.
poenales autem actiones, quas supra diximus, si ab ipsis
principalibus personis suerint contestatae, et heredibus dantur

whom it originally accrued‚ may still be exercised by his heir, is said
to be actively transmissible; one which, though not exercised against
the person originally liable, may still be exercised against his heir, is
said to be passively transmissible.

Active transmission, as Justinian remarks, is the rule. Those rights
os action only are excepted (ot which the actio iniuriarum is here taken
as a type) which arc grounded not on a damnum or injury to property,
but on a grievance or insult to the person; eg. among others, the
querella inofficiosi testamenti, Dig. 5. 2. 6. 2, and the remedy os a patron
or pater against a freedman or child who commenced legal proceedings
against him without the praetors pennission, Tit.16.3ins. The point ol
the distinction is well put by Theophilus, ἔνθα γὰρ τὸ γενόμενον ἁμάρτημα
ε’λαπαῑ τὴν τοῦ μὲλλοντος τελευτᾷν περιουσίαν, τότε καὶ d κληρονόμος, ὦς
συναδικούμενος, τὴν dard τοῦ ἁμαρτήματος ἀγωγὴν κινήσει . . ,Ἐπειδὴ . . . οὗ
μειοῖ τὴν ὑπόστασιν, εἰκότος καὶ ὄκληρονόμοςό ε’μός, ὣς μὴ συναδικηθείς,
τοία-ην οὔχ ἕξει.

The chief exceptions to passive transmission are the actiones populares,
Dig. 47. 23. 7. 8, and (as is observed in the text) penal actions arising ex
delicto. Actione which are purely poenae persecutoriae are passively
transmissible only when they are absolutely the only remedy on the
wrong (e. g. the actio on calumnia, Dig. 3. 6. 5. pn), and then only sofar
as the inheritauce has been enriched thereby; and this same principle ol
the liability os the heir to the extent to which the inheritance has been
benefited applies also to actions (ς) which, though grounded on delict,
are purely rei persecutoriae (e. g. actio doli, Dig. ι, 3 17. 1, quod metus
causa, Dig. 4 α. ι6. 2); (a) which are mixtae, except where an action
which is purely rei persecutoria lies on the same delict (eg. the condictio
furtiva on rapina, Dig. 47. 8. 2. 27). Condictio furtiva, not being based
on delict, lies against the thiet‘s heir in solidum, Tit. 1. 19 supr, Dig. 13.
1. 7. 2; ibo

The examples given by Gaius (iv. 113) os actions which, though arising
ex contractu, are either actively or passively untransmissible, create no
difficulty: ‘adstipulatoris heres non habet actionem, et sponsoris et fide·
promissoris non tenetur.’ But Justinian's statement in the text that where
a party to a contract hasbeen guilty oi dolus his heir is not suable, ir he
has personally derived no advantage from the fraud, is contradicted by a

large number ot passages in the Corpus iuris; e. g. Dig. 50. 17.157.2: ‘in
