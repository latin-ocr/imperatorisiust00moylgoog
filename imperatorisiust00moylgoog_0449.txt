must be divided among all according to the principles stated in §§ 1-3
31111030111101331 Dig. 1736351 111.67.111.

The remedy by which partners enlorced these duties against one
another was the actio pro socio, condemnation in which entailed 10130113,
Bk. iv. 16. 22 101.; but the defendant could claim beneficium com-
petentiae against the rest, i. 3. they were not entitled to talre all his
property in satisfaction 01 their claims, but must leave him enough to
supply the bare necessities 01 1113, Book iv. 6. 38 ini, though Dig. 42. 1,
16 (perhaps incorrectly) limits the beneficium to societas oinnium bono·
rum. Division 01 the joint property could be compelled by the actio
communi dividundo, Bk. iv. 6. 301 ib. 28 ; iv. 17. 5101.

The question 01 the rights 01 113110313 against, and their duties towards,
third persons, is 3 different one. 11 311 the partners together enter into
a contract with some 003 3133, they are entitled and bound iu relation 10
himin the ratio 01 their shares in the lucrum and damnum: ‘si tamen
plures per se navem exerceant, proportionibus exercitionis conveniuntur,
neque invicem sui magistri videntur’ Dig. 14 1.4.111., ‘quamvis actio
ex empto cum singulis sit per portione, qua socii luerunt' Dig. 21. 1. 44.
1. By special agreement such contract may produce an active or passive
0011331 obligation 10 iavour 01 01 binding the partners, and where they
are banlrers such an obligation results ipso iure from all strictly banlring
transactions entered into by any 01 them: ‘si plures sint qui eandem
actionem habent, unius 1000 habentur: utputa plures sunt rei stipulandi
vel plures argentarii, quorum nomina simul iacta sunt; unius 1000 nume·
rabuntur, quia unum debitum est’ Dig. 3. 14, 9. pr. 3 ib. 25. pr. ; ib. 27.
But ii the contract is made by 0030130013 only 01 the 113110313,1113
question arises how 131 they confer rights and impose obligations on the
rest. 11 the transactionis clearly a partnership transaction, the latter
can sue upon it only as assignees, even though it was entered into by
their own express instructions, though they are entitled to a cessio 01
the right 01 action, which, 11 necessary, they can compel by judicial
process.

As regards their liabilities, it should be carelully observed that the
partnership is never conceived as a fictitious person, capable in ltsell 01
having rights and owing duties, as distinct from the 113110313; 1113131131
cannot claim that business 0131111013,10 the event 01 the firm becoming
insolvent, shall limit their demands to the partnership assets, though
they can insist on the latter being proceeded against and exhausted
first, Dig. 17. 2. 65. 14. Three cases, in which the contract is not made
by all the partners collectively, need to be distinguished:
