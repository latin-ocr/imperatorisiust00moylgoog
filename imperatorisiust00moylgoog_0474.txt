ORIGIN ANB DE VELOPMENT OF BON. POSSESSIO. 459

possessio¹ obtained undere praetorian will; in other words, the latter
was sinere

Savigny connects the praetorian system of succession, in origin,
with the old usucapio pro herede (Gaius ii. 52-56) which ,the civil
law regarded with approval (‘ quod voluerunt veteres maturius heredi-
tates adiri, ut essent qui sacra iacerent, quorum illis temporibus
summa observatio fuit, et ut creditores haberent, a quo suum con·
sequerentur’ ib. 55) and oi which the praetor laid hold as the starting·
point of his innovatione ; he gave the possession to certain persons
who, it was admitted, had an equitable, though not a legal, right to the
estate, and devised, in the interdict quorum bonorum, a remedy by
which they could recover the deceased’s property irorn other pos·
sessors, thus placing them in a position to become owners by usu·
capio; the practical assimilation of the bonorum possessor to the
heres, and the introduction os the possessoris hereditatis petitio,
being dne to the identification of bona fide possession with boni-
tarian ownership. Others (e. g. Hugo) think bonorum possessio was
based, in all essential points, on the ius gentium, and was in origin
the system applied in the succession to aliens by the praetor pere·
grinus‚ irom whose edict it was gradually translened to the edictum
urbanum. This, though α priori an attractive theory, seems untenable
on account oi the tenderness which the praetor almost ostentatiously
showed sor the civil law and the agnatic conception ol kinship; a
gentile system of inheritance would have been based solely on cogna-
tion. Niebuhr connects bonomm possessio with the possessio of ager
publicus (p. 326 supr), with the succession to which alone he thinks
it was originally concerned; but this, as has been remarked, is
irreconcileable with the very name donorum possessi0, and improbable
on general grounds.
