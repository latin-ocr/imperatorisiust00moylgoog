22 INTRODUCTION.

magistracy lor sorry-tour years. Seven years before that date C.Licinius
Stolo had renewed the plebeian agitation sor admission to the consul-
ship, and in nc. 367 he succeeded in procuring a statute by which
the military tribuneship was abolished, and it was provided that one
at least of the consuls should be chosen lrom the plebs. The same
date is usually assigned to the introduction oi the praetorship, an office
which seems really to have been in existence sor some time previously,
and oi which more will be said hereaster. The praetor was charged
with the administration oi civil justice and the general management of
domestic affairs, solatas they had not been already appropriated to
existing offices. The institution oi the cumle aedileship belongs to the
same period, an office at first exclusively patrician, but soon thrown open
to the plebeians also; the aedile’s iunctione, which at first related only
to certain affairs peculiar to the patrician order, such as the garnes oi
the great festivals, were very shortly extended to all matters, whether
connected with the public health, religion, morality, streets, buildings,
or security os person and property, so iar as they could be placed
under the control oi police.

Besides the lex Licinia by which the consulship was opened to
the plebs, there are two others of the same name, which were due to
the energy os the sarne Licinius Stolo. Ol these one was designed to
relieve embarrassed debtors by striking off from the amount oi their
principal debts the sums which they had paid as interest, and by
allowing them an interval lor the complete satisfaction ol their
creditors3 the other was a land law in lavour oi small holdings¹ which
prohibited even the richest from owning more than five hundred
iugera of land, and a certain number oi sheep and cattle. Before
long too an adequate senatorial representation oi the plebs was
secured by the lex Ouinia (circ. 320 sc), which directed the censors,
in the selection of the senate, to choose the fittest persons without
distinction of order: ‘. . . . donec Ovinia intervenit, qua sanctum est
ut censores ex omni ordine optimum quemque curiatim (iurati,
Meier, cx coniectura) in senatum legerent’ (Festus). Magistrates oi
curule rank (consuls, praetors, and aediles) were members oi the
senate rx effere, and retained their scats even at the end ol their year
oi office, until the nerrt revision of that body by the censors, when their
reelection depended on the view which those magistrates took of
their merits. .

The leges Publiliae (nc. 339) effected a considerable resonn in the
comitia. lt bas been already noticed that the lex Horatia Valeria had
restored the comitia tributa alter the second secession oi the plebs;
