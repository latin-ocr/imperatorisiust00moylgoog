guards against errors of form which gave the legis actio its twoedged
character. Any such error, however trivial it might be, entailed com·
plete and irrevocable loss of action, for the maxim ‘nemo decadem
re bis experiri potest' forbade the bringing of a second suit: and yet
the chances of such mistake were so innumerable‚ the path of the
litigant was so beset with the pitfalls of formabam, that justice must
have been only too often defeated Thus, in manus iniectio, and
pignoris capio, the proceedings took place to a large extent, if not
entirely, ont of court; and yet the slightest slip, even in an ignorant
creditor, brought upon him irremediable defeat. In the succeeding
system, as is remarlred by Mr. Poste ¹, no litigant could commit a
suicidal error before the final moment at which the suit was trans-
ferred from praetor to iudex. In the same note he calls attention to the
rigidity os statute-Process-its want of power of expansion. The
forms of action were crystallised in the law, and incapable of multi·
plicati0n; the right presupposed the remedy, not the remedy the
right; the praetor himself had his hands tied, and was a mere piece
of machincry. Anew order of things was inaugurated by the lex Ι
Aebutia, circ. 170 rac.

With a few reservations ⁸, this statute abolished the legis actio pro·
cedure, though wc do not know whether its action was exclusively
destructive. It is usual to spealr of it as having ‘introduced' the
formulary system3 but it is quite uncertain whether the outlines ol
· the latter were sketched in the statute, or whether it left the praetor
to devise and apply a new procedure at his own discretion. But,
whatever its source, the new system has two leading features. One is
the universal division of every judicial proceeding or action into two
portions, one which took place before the praetor, in iure, and the
other which took place before the iudex, in iudicio. We have seen
the growing tendency towards this iu the legis actio period. So long as

¹ The cases in which saturetroeess was allowed to survive were (ι) those
which had to be tried in the decemviral and centumviral courts, where the pro·
cedure was by sacramentnm (a) damnvm infectum (note on Bk. iii. 18. 2 supr),
where, according to Mr. Poste, it was by iudicis arbitrive postulatio, though Beth·
rnanu-Hollweg ismore probably right iu supposingit to have been a case of pignoris
capi0; and (3) the voluntary jurisdiction, such as datio in adoptionem, manumissio
vindicta, aud in iure cessio: see Keller, Civil Process i 24. Gaius says (iv. 30)
that the two leges Iuliae (passed in the reign of Augustus) assisted in the over·
throw of statute-Prooess All that they seem to· have done, however, was to
abolish the decemviri as an independent court, combining them in some wey with
the centumviri, and to limit the jurisdiction of the latter. Puchta, Inst i 163, ef
