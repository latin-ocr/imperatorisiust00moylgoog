dence of the independent position which private law had won for
itself under plebeian auspices, and at the same time starts it on a
new career of development3 it was no longer the peculias province
of the plebeian order; but having been sanctioned by the whole
populus in its comitia, it began to be looked 011 111010 by 011 parties
as the best security for order and prosperity. But this is part of a
subject on which there is great diversity of opinion, and to which
we shall shortly return-the relation, at Rome, 01 private to public
law.

English lawyers in particular will fully appreciata the advantage
which was secured by the expression of the law in amore scientific
and therefore more convenient form than thatin which it had hitherto
been clothed. But it was a still larger boon that provision was made
for its being generally known by all citizens who cared to make them·
selves acquainted with 11. 111010110οΙ analogy would perhaps lead us
to suppose that the knowledge of the law had hitherto been engrossed
by the patriciam caste, as represented by the pontifices, who 010 de-
scribed in a passage of Pomponius already cited (Dig. r. a. 2. 6) as
the only masters 01 the legal rules and forms of procedure at that

was to a large degree 01 plebeian creation, and the sole possession of
legal knowledge by a dominant aristocracy is truer of the Greek
oligarchies than of Rome, of which we may, with some qualificatiom
accept the view 01 the German historical school of jurists, who assert
that the material law was 110 secret, being founded on the common

plebeian could know little, through their implication with the ius
