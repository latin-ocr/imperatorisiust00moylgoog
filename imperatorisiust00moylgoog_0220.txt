Dig. 8. 1. ις. 1. (2) The right ol servitude is extinguished so soon as

the person in whom it is vested becomes dominus of the res serviens,
or vice versa: ‘nulli res sua servit’ Dig. 8. a. 27. (3) One servitude
cannot be the object oi another: ‘servitus servitutis essenon potest’
Dig. 33. 2. 1. (4) A servitude must not merely limit the rights os the
dominus, but it must confer a positive advantage on the other party,
Dig. 8. 1. 15. (5) Servitudes being created solely lor the advantage ol a
definite subject, they are intransserable, or inseparable t'rom the subject
itsels, Dig. 10. 2153 8.4 12.

The meaning ol the distinction between praedial (or real) and personal
servitudes is explained in ξ 3 oi the next Title. (r) A praedial servitude
can belong to a man only as being owner oi a parcel of land or a house
(praedium); be can have a personal servitude without any such limita-
tion. The latter can be enjoyed over any object oi property 3 the former
only over another praedium, adjoining (Dig. 8. 3. 5. 1) that in whose
iavour it exists‚ and to which it is appurtenant. Thus there cannot be a
praedia] servitude without two praedia, called the praedium dominans
and the praedium serviens. (2) The right must be of such a nature
that by it the use and enjoyment os the praedium dominans is increased,
or rendered more complete and effectual. lt is consequently inseparable
from the latter, passing with it when conveyed, and its maximum extent
or orbit is determined only by the requirements os the praedium to which
it is attached, Dig. 8. 3. 5. 1. (3) But the owner os the praedium domi·
nans must exercise his right with proper regard sor the other party,
civiliter modo, Dig. 8. 1. 9 while the latter is bound to permit him to do
all acts necessary lor its due enjoyment, such as repairs‚ ib. ιο. (4) The
nature os a praedial servitude is further illustrated by the rule ‘omnes
servitutes praediorum perpetuas causas habere debent’ Dig. 8. 2. 283
i. a no right can be a praedial servitude whose enjoyment necessitates
constant action on the part os the owner of the praedium serviens, or
which can in tha nature oi things be enjoyed only ior a limited time,
‘ideo neque ex lacu neque ex stagno concedi aquae ductus potest' Dig.
loc. cit. (5) ‘Servitutes (praediorum) ipso quidem iure neque ex tempore,
neque ad tempus, neque sub condicione, neque ad certam condicionem
constitui possuot' Dig. 8. r. 4. 2

Different views are beld as to the rationale of the division of praedia!
servitudes into rustic and urban. According to some, it turns upon the
nature os the praedium dominans, the question being whether this is a
building merely, or a piece ot' land comparatively free from buildings,
such as a fanu or a country estate : others regard only the nature of the
praedium serviens; while a third school determines the species os
servitude purely by reference to its content, holding that where the right
consists in iaciendo, it is rustic, where in habendo or prohibendo, urban.
The following Titles will make the distinction clear.
