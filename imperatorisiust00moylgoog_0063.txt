48 INTRODUCTION.

Under Augustus we first lind traces ol a division ol the y'urists into
two sects or schools. Their respective leaders, distinguished from
one another bya difference of political no less than oi legal views,
were Antistius Labeo and C. Ateius Capito. Labeo had inherited from
his father Quintus a strong republican sentiment, and was in the habit
oi lamenting the prevailing disrespect ol the good old laws which
had never been constitutionally abrogated. At first an auditor oi
Trebatius, he attended the chambers ol all the prominent yurists ol his
day; and the width ol his studies liberalised his views on law, and
saved him srorn a lailing which was not uncommon among his con-
temporarios, a slavish devotion to the tenets ol' some particular
teacher. A manos varied culture and instructed in lar more than one
department ol knowledge, his leading characteristica were a wide
intellectual range, a correct appreciation ol the place ol law in social
development and ol its relation to other sciences, a dislilre ol all
pedantry, a wealth ol new views and principles, with which he was
ever ready to challenge and supersede the old. Sixty·three excerpts
from his writings are preserved in the Digest. Capito was more or less
ol a novus hom0, and a supporter ol the imperial rlgr'me, in which he
saw the best prospecta oi his own advancement. It is related ol him
that, with a lalse show ol independence, he opposed Tiberius when the
latter wished to stop the prosecution ol a man accused of putting an
affront upon the imperial dignity. As a jurist, he was distinguished
by a devotion to the letter os the law and the traditional treatment oi
legal questions, and by atoo literal interpretation ol positive rules.

The opposition between the two was thus the opposition between
an absolute reliance on traditional principles and opinions supported
by approved authority, and a legahnrind consciens os its powers, oi
the living organic nature ol law, oi the inevitableness oi its growth
and expansion. It resulted in a number of legal controversies be·
tween Labeo and Capito, which they bequeathed to their successors ;
thus originating the two schools whose disputes were ever widening
their range, and which termed their founders and leaders ‘nostri
praeceptores,' and those of their opponente ‘diversae scholae prae-
ceptores,' respectively. The leading disciple ol Capito was Masurius ,
Sabinus (Gaius ii. 218), from whom the school derived its name
‘Sabinian,' and who, as having given it a new direction, isto be
regarded as its proper founder. Capito had contented himself with a·
passive resistance to Labeo's innovatione ; Sabinus and his lollowers
even went so lar as to adopt Labeo's tendency to develope new viena,

but were carelul to disagree from the other school whenever ao
