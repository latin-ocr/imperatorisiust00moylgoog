Tit. 8.] DE NOXALIBUS ACTIONIBUS. 561

ei quoque, qui vel exercitoria vel institoria actione tenetur,
directo posse condicl placet, quia huius quoque iussu con·

Ex maleficiis servorum, v'eluti si furtum fecerint aut bona

rapuerint aut damnum dederint aut iniuriam commiserint, ⁴

noxales actiones proditae sunt, quibus domino damnato per-
mittitur aut litis aestimationem sufferre aut hominem noxae

condictio will lie against the dominus in lieu of actio institoria. lt is,
however, not a necessary inference from such passages that the civil law .
modified its own maxim, stated in the first note on this Title‚ though
this is the explanation of Schrader, who says ‘forsan civiles actiones,
olim paucis casibus datae, postea demum ita creverunt, ut eundem fere
ambitum, quem honorariae statim ab initio occupabant, tenerent! But,
as Savigny remarks (Oblig.§ 54), this makes it difficult to understand
why the actiones adiectitiae qualitatis should be described in the Corpus
inrisas not only still useful but indispensable; and Savigny himself,
noticing that it is only condictio (and not actiones civiles in general)
which is spoken of as alternative to the praetorian remedies, limits its ,
application to cases where the slave or filiusfamilias had borrowed money
with the superior's consent, or spent it, when borrowed, in his interest.
This conjecture is supported by the fact that in the text above the con·
currence of condictio with the actiones adiectitiae qualitatis is generally

ι affirmed, with the exception of de peculio 3 and (as we have just seen) if

a filiusfamilias borrowed money, both condictio and de peculio were
barred by the SC. Macedonianum, Cod. 4 28. 6, Dig. 14. 6. 7. ro, which,
however, did not exclude institoria and the rest. Another view is that
the ground of the condictio was not the slave's or filiusfamilias' contract,
but the simple fact that the superior had been enricbed- at the eost of the
other contracting party. '

uit. VIII. If a slave committed a delict by his master’s orders, the
latter alone was answerable : ‘servus nil deliquit qui domiuo iubenti ob-
temperavit ;' and even iu other cases, if the master suspected and could
have prevented the wrong, the injured person had his choice between a
direct and a noxal action, Dig. 9. 4. 2-5. Otherwise the slave only was
directly liable, and if manumitted could be sued, § 5iuf, Dig. ib. 6, unless
it was against his own master that the delict had been committed, ξ 6 inf.
While, however, he remained a slave no action could be brought against
him, and accordingly the master could be sued on his account, though,
as he was not bound to defend, he would probably prefer to abandon him
to the plaintiff if the proofs were clear. II he defended the action, it was
