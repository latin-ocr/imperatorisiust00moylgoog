therefore (all) Possession is equivalent to Equitable ownership, is
obvious.

Mr. Hunter seems to have been led into what we cannot but regard
as other than a completely wrong theory by not rigidly confining his
attention to Possession-not this possession or that possession, but
all Possession-whether bona lide or mala fide. His insurmountable
difficulty lies in the impossibility 01 identisying Possession, when ¹
accompanied by mala fides, with Eqmtable ownership. Upon mala
lide Possession he is inconsistent. In one passage (p. 205) he says,
‘the interdicts were open equally to mala fide possessors ;' in another
(p. aoo), ‘the mala fide possessor 01 moveables had no right against
third persons! The latter statement, which is based solely on the
inability of a mala fide possessor to bring an actio 111111 01 bonorum
vi raptorum, is shown to be untrue, so sar as interdicts are concemed,
by Savigny and by Dr. Wallrer (Selected Titles from the Digest,
Introduction to Digest 41. a): and interdicte are all that here we
need concern ourselves with; other remedies are not for the protec-
tion 01 Possession at all. In lact, Mr. Hunter's general position
seems delensible only to this extent, viz. that where a man has usu·
. capion Possession, he also has Equitable ownership.

For a discussion 01 the question, to what part 01 the Roman system
the doctrine ol Possession logically belongs, see Poste, Gaius pp.
648 sqq.; and sor the possessory interdicts, and the cases to which
they were individually applicable, Bk. iv. Title 15, and notes ins.
