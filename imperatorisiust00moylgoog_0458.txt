que tenetur, ut administrationis rationem reddat. quo casu
ad exactissimam quisque diligentiam compellitur reddere 11-
tionem: nec sufficit talem diligentiam adhibere, qualem suis
rebus adhibere soleret, si modo alius diligentior commodius

torian origin : ‘ait praetor, si quis negotia alterius, sive quis negotia, quae
cuiusque curn is moritur suerit, gesserit, iudicium eo nomine dabo. Hoc
edictum necessarium est, quoniam magna utilitas absentium vertitur, ne
indefensi rerum possessionem aut venditionem patiantur, vel pignoris
distractionem, vel poenae committendae actionem, vel iniuria rem suam
amittant' Dig. 3. 5. 3. 1. To constitute the relation it is necessary that
the business in which the gestor interieres should be some one's else and
not his own, Dig. ib. 6. 4 (no stress should be laid on ‘absentes’ in our
text), and that his interierence should not be grounded on any office or
express mandate on which he can sue; 11 there hasbeen a mandatum,
but no actio mandati lies, he ean sue as negotiorum gestor, Dig. ib. 19. 2.
His duties are in substance the same as those 011 commissioned agent,
101 which see on Tit. 26. 8 supr. Those 01 the dominus negotii are
mainly to indemnify the gestor against all reasonable expenses, with
interest, and to guarantee him against all liabilities which 111 has in-
curred on his behali, Dig. ib. ro. pr.; but 1111 gestor could not ensorce
these duties by actio contraria, unless

(1) The dominus had not prohibited his interierence, Cod. 2. 19. 242

(2) His own intention in undertaking 1111 business had been to lay the
other under a legal obligation‚ ‘negotia eo anirno gerit, ut aliquem sibi

’ obliget' Dig. 10. 3.141; so that 11 his object was his own sole ad·

vantage he could sue the dominus only so 111 as the latter had derived
material benefit 110111 his gestio, Dig. 3. 5. 6. 3. 11 he unwittingly in·
111111111 with another person’s business (e. g. as being a bona fide
possessor) 111 could assert his claim to compensation 101 reasonable
outlay only by exceptio, unless what he ‘possessed' was an hereditas, in
which case he had an action, Dig. ib. 49; 10. 3·. 14, 1 ; ib. 29· pr.

(3) The state 01 the dominus' affairs was such that, except 101 the
foreign intervention, he would be seriously prejudiced, Dig. 44. 7. 5. pr. ;
11 this is so, the gestor can recover even though the anticipated benefit as
a 1111 is not realized, or, as it is sometimes put, the negotia need not
have been utiliter gesta, it is enough 11 they were utiliter coepta, Dig. 15.
3. 10. 1 ς ib. 12. 2. litha gestio was not thus warranted, but the gestofs
object was to secure 1 great advantage sor the dominus, he could recover
only so 111 as the advantage actually went, Dig. ib. 11 ; ib. 43.

Subsequent ratification 01 the gestio by the dominus transforms the
relation into mandatum according to Ulpian in Dig. 42. 1. 60, while
Scaevola in Dig. 3 5. 9 says that its character remains unaltered The
solution os the antinomy is probably that aster ratification the gestor can
treat the dominus as mandator, but the latter (ratification being merely a
unilateral act) is not entitled to treat the former as mandatarius.
