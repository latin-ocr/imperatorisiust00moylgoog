ldedere. Noxa autem est corpus quod nocuit, id est servus:
noxia ipsum maleficium, veluti furtum damnum rapina iniuria.
2Summa autem ratione permissum est noxae deditione de-
fungi: namque erat iniquum nequitiam eorum ultra ipsorum
3corpora dominis damnosam esse. Dominus noxali iudicio
servi sui nomine conventus servum actori noxae dedendo
liberatur. nec minus perpetuum eius dominium a domino
transfertur: si autem damnum ei cui deditus est resarcierit
quaesita pecunia, auxilio praetoris invito domino manumit-
4tetur. Sunt autem constitutae noxales actiones aut legibus

called noxalis because the defendant had the option, if the guilt of the
slave was proved, of surrendering him to the plaintiff in lieu of paying the
damages assessed: ‘praetor ait . . . si servus insciente domino fecisse
dicetur, in iudicio adiciam “ aut noxam dedere '³’ Dig. 9. 3. 1. pr. N oxal
actions are thus not a class of remedies apart by themselves, but only
ordinary actions on delict or quasi-delict (Dig. loc. cit), in which the
defendant, being sued on a wrong not of his own commission, is allowed
by special provision (§ 4 inf.) a privilege which, bad the offense been his
own, he would not have enjoyed. In principle, though not in form, they
are arbitrariae (Tit. 6. 3¹ supr.) ; the noxae deditio is not made in accord·
ance with the judge's arbitrium, but the defendant is condemned in the
alternative, Tit. 17. 1 inf. lf the slave died before litis contestatio in the
action, the master’s liability ended, even though his death was unknown,
Dig. 9.4 39. 4; ih.42. 1 : by his death during the action the masters
liability in damages became absolute, ib. 3.

lt has been conjectured that noxal actions were originally the expres·
sion of an absolute claim to have the offender delivered up for the exercise
of private vengeance, whether his ofsence were delictual or merely breach
of contract. The surrender of Postumius to the Samnites hythe Romans
with all the forms of noxae deditio (Livy ix. 10) was made as atonement
for non-ohservance of the treaty which he had concluded with them, and
from which the Romans wished to release themselves-ut populus re-
ligione solvatur. Under Roman municipal law non-fulfilment of a promise
made by sponsio entailed, in the end, quasi-slavery (manus iniectio);
and the idea was consistently applied by them in intemational relations;
cf. lhering, Geist des r. Rechts i. p. 131 ; Mt. Ο. W. Holmes' Common
Law pp. 8-12‚ and Mr. Poste’s note on Gaius iv. 81.

§3 The rufe that if the surrendered slave subsequently contrived to
pay the damages he could demand his manumission, appears to have

originally held only where the deditus was a child in power ; ‘per homi· ’

nem liberum noxiae deditum si tantum adquisitum sit, quantum dam-
num dedit, manumittere cogendus est a praetore qui noxa deditum
accepit, sed fiduciae iudicio non tenetur' Papinian, Colla. 3.
