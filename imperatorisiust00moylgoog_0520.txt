Tiar] DE OBLIGATIONIBUS QUAE, ETC. 505

Furti autem actio el competit, cuius interest rem salvam 13
esse, licet dominus non sit: itaque nec domino aliter competit,
quarn si eius intersit rern non perire. Unde constat creditorem 14
de pignore subrepto furti agere posse, etiamsi idoneum de-
bitorem habeat, quia expedit ei pignori potius incumbere quarn
in personam agere: adeo quidem ut, quamvis ipse debitor
eam rem subripuerit, nihilo minus creditori competit actio
furti. Item si lullo polienda curandave aut sarcinator sar-15
cienda vestimenta mercede certa acceperit eaque furto amiserit,
ipse furti habet actionem, non dominus, quia domini nihil
interest earn rern non perire, cum iudicio locati a fullone aut
sarcinatore rem suam persequi potest. sed et bonae fidei
emptori subrepta requam emerit, quamvis dominus non sit,
omnimodo competit furti actio, quemadmodum et creditori.
lulloni vero et sarcinatori non aliter surti competere placuit,
quarn si solvendo sint, hoc est si domino rei aestimationem
solvere possint: namsi solvendo non sunt, tunc quia ab eis

the pater the filius, even alter he had lest his power, Tit. 8. 6 inl'.: but
the offender could be punished at once by invoking the aid of the praetor
if the thelt was serious, Dig. 48. 19. rr. r.

ᾗ 13. The object ol the actio furti was the recovery ol the poena dupli
or quadrupli fixed by law. The rule as to who could bring it is sirni-
larly laid down by Gaius iii. 203, and Paulus; ‘furti actione is agere potest,
culus interest rern non periisse ² sent. rec 2. 3¹· 4 All os these statements,
however, are somewhat too wide: ‘neque . . . . cuiuscunque intererit,
rem non perire, habet furti actionem’ Dig. 47. 2. 14. ro: the action lay at

Ι the suit only of the owner, bona fide possessor, or person who had
detention os or some real right (e. g. usufruet, hypotheca) in the stolen
property less than ownership, and then only ir he was prejudiced by the
thest. Hence the vendee before delivery was debarred from suing in his
own name, Dig. 47. a 14. pr.: ib. 80. pr., as also was the depositary
under ordinary circumstances, §r7ins., and all others who had merely
rights in personam in respect of the property stolen, e. g. the promisee in
a stipulation, Dig. 18. r. 35. 4.

ξ 14. lt seems at one time to have been doubtful whether the pledgee
ought to be allowed to bring aetio lorti ir the pledgor was solvent
(idoneus) 3 ‘sed utrum semper creditoris interest, an ita demum, si debitor
solvendo non est? et putat Pomponius semper eius interesse pignus

habere, quod et Papinianus . . . probat’ Dig. 47. 2. 12. 2. Papinian even
thought that is two things were pledged tor one debt, and one of them

was stolen, the pledgee ought to be allowed actio furti even il the other
alone was adequate security, Dig. ib. 14. 5.
ς 15. The clothes are at the risk of the lullo or sarcinator, Dig. 47. 14
