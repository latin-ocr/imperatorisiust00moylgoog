lEGES PUBLILIAE AND HORTENSIA. 23

and it seems not improbable that, by that statute, it was provided that
plebiscita which had no constitutional import, or which related to
matters ol purely private law, should not require confirmation by the
centuries to acquire universal validity. The first of the leges Publiliae
apparently extended this exemption to all plebiscita, whatever their
content, the effect of it being, as stated by Livy (viii ra), ‘ ut plebiscita
omnes Quirites tenerent ι’ from this we should doubtless inser that the
patricians now entered as fully into the business ol the comitia tributa
as into that os the assemhly ol the centuries. The necessity oi sena·
torial sanction to plebiscita was, however, not yet dispensed with; this
was effected by the lex Hortensia, uc. 287 (lust. i. a. 4), which was
the outcome os a third plebeian secession, and the final act by which
resolutione oi the plebs were placed on a footing of complete equality
with leges passed in the comitia centuriata (‘ sed postea lex Hortensia
lata cst, qua cautum est ut plebiscita universum populum tenerent;
itaque eo modo legibus exaequata sunt’ Gaius i. 3). The numbers ol
the plebs were largely augmented s. c. 312, when Appius Caecus, the
censor, distributed among the tribes a great mass of libertini, a term
which at this epoch denoted the lreeborn descendants ol a manu-
mitted slave ¹. These libertini were thus enrolled in the centuries,
and possessed very considerable influenee through the wealth which
they derived lrom their almost exclusive control oi Roman handicrasts
aud commerce, occupations which were deemed humiliating and
derogatory to genuine Quirites; in Rome they played the part, and
exercised the influence, though in a lar less degree, which with us are
connected with ‘the city.’ Eight years later than the censorship of
Appius Caecus, the democratic tendency oi his measure was to sorne
degree oounteracted by the new censore, Q. Fabius and P. Decius,
who confined the ‘lorensis turba’ of libertini to the lour city moes,
and thus reduced the preponderance which the lower orders had ac-
quired in the two important comitia.

The effect oi the second lex Publilia, according to Livy, was ‘ut
legum quae comitiis centuriatis ferrentur ante initum suffragium patres
auctores frerent3’ it thus merely reaffirmed the constitutional doctrine,
that no bill shoidd be submitted to the centuries, with a view to its
becuming law, unless it had been previously approved by the senate.
It is clear from Cicero that in his time the Servian centurial constitu-
tion had undergone considerable alteratione, effected by in some way
combining the centurial organizanon with that oi the tribes. The
