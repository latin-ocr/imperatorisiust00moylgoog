nothing at all as heirs, or at least the portion they can take is limited
by law. Between these two classes there is an important difference.
The will is void, il the person instituted lacks testamenti factio at the
date either of the execution ol the will, or os the testator’s decease, or at
which he ought to make aditio, Dig. 28. 5. 49. 1, Tit. 19 4inl. But
where one ol the second class was instituted, the will was never void on
that ground alone, and capacity to take was required to exist only at the
time when the benelit vested: ‘non oportet prius de condicione cuius·
quam quaeri, quam hereditas legatumve adeum pertinet!

Those who could not be validly instituted at all are (r) peregrini ; (2)
intestabiles, Dig. 28. 1. 18. 1, ib. 26; Theoph. ad lnst. ii. 10. 6, though
the incapacity ol this class in Justinian's time has been doubted3 (3)
heretics, Cod. 1. 5. 4, and apostateS, eod. 1. 7. 3 and 43 (4) children ol
persons convicted ol treason, Cod. 9. 8. 5. 1 3 (5) children ol and parties
to unlawr‘ul marriages could not be instituted, the former by the parents,
the latter by one another, Cod. 5. 5. 6 ; 5. 9. 6, ib. 27. 2 ς (6) incertae per·
sonae, in particular (a) postumi ; but the last relic of this rule, viz. that a
postumus alienus could not be instituted heir or take a legacy was
repealed by Justinian himself, Tit. 20. 28, Blc iii. 9. pr. ini: and (b)
juristic persons, Ulpian, reg. 22. 5. This restriction had, however, to a
large extent been removed; the fiscus could be instituted heir, and so
could municipal corporations (Cod.6.24. 12), churches, and religious
and charitable foundations (cod. 1. 2. rand 23). Other corporations
could acquire testamenti factio only by special grant from the Emperor,
Cod. 6. 24 8 ; (7) the lex Voconia, tac. 169, had made women incapable

¹ ol being instituted heirs to persons ranked in the highest class of the

census as possessing 100,ooo sesterces or upwards (Gaius ii. 274), though
they might be legatees to the extent os half the property, Quintil declam.
264. This disqualilication was quite obsolete under Justinian.

Among the enactments disabling certain classes from taking undere
will either in whole or in part are the following :-

(r) By the lex lunia Norbana Latini Iuniani were prohibited from
taking either as heirs or as legatees, unless they acquired the civitas
within roo days, Gaius i. 23-4, ii. rro, 275, Ulpian, reg. 17. r.

(2) By a lex Iulia of Augustus, the coelebs (unmarried person) could
take nothing under the will os one unrelated to him or her within the
sixth degree as'either heir or legatee, unless he or she married within
roo days next alter hearing os the right. Certain classes were excepted
on account ol' age, physical incapacity, ete, Ulpian, reg. 14. 16 and 18.

(3) By the lex Papia Poppaea, live years later in date, the orbus (i. e.
person who had been married but had no children living, Ulpian, reg.
ro. 1) could take under wills of persons outside the sixth degree onlya
moiety of what was given them. One child was sufficient to save a man
lrom the statute, sor ingenuae three, for libertae four were required.
