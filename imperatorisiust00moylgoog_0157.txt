2civili data ac permissa. Tutores autem sunt, qui eam vim ac
potestatem habent, ex qua re ipsa nomen ceperunt. itaque
appellantur tutores quasi tuitores atque defensores, sicut
saeditui dicuntur qui aedes tuentur. Permissum est itaque
parentibus liberis impuberibus, quos in potestate habent, testa·
mento tutores dare. et hoc in lilio liliaque omnimodo procedit ;
nepotibus tamen neptibusque ita demum parentes possunt
testamento tutores dare, si post mortem eorum in patrissui
potestatem recasuri non sunt. itaque si filius tuus mortis tuae
tempore in potestate tua sit, nepotes ex eo non poterunt
testamento tuo tutorem habere, quamvis in potestate tua
fuerint3 scilicet quia mortuo te in patris sui potestatem re-

duntaxat his vestibus, quae detritae usu, aut corruptae servando servari
non potuerint Animalia quoque supervacua minorum, quin veneant,
non vetamus' Cod 5. 37. 22. Justinian forbade tutors and curatore to
intermeddle in the ward’s affairs until they had caused a complete in-
ventory of his property to be made, Cod. 5. 51. ult. But on ceasing to
be infans the pupil was held to acquire a power of volition, and thereby
capacity of disposition; yet his lack of intellectual powers was thought
likely to betray him into transactione by which he might be injured, and
thus the rule was established, that for all acts by which the pupil could
possibly injure his proprietary interests the guardian’s auctoritas was
necessary, though the former was regarded as himself the acting party,
especially in dispositione which were iuris civilis, and therefore ‘procura-
torem non recipiebant3’ see Tit. 21. pr. inf, and cf. the note on Bk. iii.
19. 1ο referred to. The relation between guardian and pupil was quasi
ex contractu Bk. iii. 27. 2 inf, q. v.

ξ 3. The right of the paterfamilias to appoint by his will tutors to such
females in his power as would become sui iuris on his decease, and to
such males in the same position as were impuberes, was established, is
not for the first time conferred, by the Xll Tables: ‘testamento quoque
nominatim tutores dati confirmantur eadem lege duodecim tabularum,
his verbis: uti legassit super pecunia tutelave suae rei, ita ius esto: qui
'tutores dativi appellantur' Ulpian, reg. 11. 14. The intended tutor must
have testamentifactio with the testator, and Latini Iuniani could not
be thus appointed, Gaius i. 24 lt would seem that a testamentary
guardian could at one time decline the office, or even lay it down aner
acceptance, Ulpian, reg. 11. 17: this right is not mentioned in Justinian,
which marks the transition from the conception of tutela as a right to
that of a munus publicum. For the formulae by which testamentary
guardians were appointed see Gaius i. 149 ; for the effect of placing such
appointment before the institution of the heir, Gaius ii. 231: cf. Tit 14.
3 inf. A testamentary guardian might be appointed by codicils testa·
mento confirmati, Dig. 26. 2. 3: ib. 8. pr.
