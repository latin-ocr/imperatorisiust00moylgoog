was emancipated, he could only demand bonorum possessio contra
tabulas. Children given in adoption had to be either instituted or dis-
inherited unless the adoptio was plena (p. 130 and supa), Cod. 8. 48. pr. r.

It is not clear what the words ‘quod et praetores postea secuti esse
videntur' refer to: perhaps to the bonorum possessio intestati, but more
probably to the bonorum possessio contra tabulas immediately before
the rescript of M. Aurelius, p. 247 supr.

§¹7. The ‘adminiculum’ referred to is the querella inofficiosi testa·
menti, for which see Tit. 18 inf.

Bonorum possessio contra tabulas, referred to in this Title, was
granted. not only to pretermitted liberi, but also, under certain circum-
stances, (a) to the parens manumissor against the will of his emancipated
son, Bk. i. 12. 6 supr, Dig. 37. 12; (b) to a patron and his agnatic de-
scendants against the will of bis libertus (Blr. iii. 7 inf.) or liberta (Gaius
i. 192, ii. 122, iii. 43-4) ; (c) to a patroness against the will of her liberta,
Gaius iii. 52.

When granted to a descendant who was not disinherited by the
ancestor in the form required by the edict, its effect, if the praeteritus
was a suus, was practically to substitute intestate succession for succes-
sion under the will; if not, its effect will appear more clearly from the
following :—

(1) Upon the pretermitted child demanding bonorum possessio, liberi
who were instituted heirs in the will came in with him under the grant
(commisso per alium edicto), and thus might be largely benefited if the ·
part in which they were instituted was less than their intestate portion,

Dig. 37. 4. 8. 142 but they could not take advantage of the bonorum
possessio if they had in any way accepted under the will. Liberi who
