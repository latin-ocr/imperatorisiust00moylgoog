id imputare debet. Creditor quoque qui pignus accepit re4
obligatur, qui et ipse de ea ipsa re quam accepit restituenda
tenetur actione pigneraticia. sed quia pignus utriusque gratia
datur, et debitoris, quo magis ei pecunia crederetur, et credi-
toris, quo magis ei intuto sit creditum, placuit sufficere, quod
ad eam rem custodiendam exactam diligentiam adhiberet:

the intention oi the parties: a mutuum is given in the interest ol the bor·
rower, or, it payment oi interest be stipulated ior, in that oi both parties:
a deposit os this kind is made in the interest oi the depositor only: and
the difference was material, for by the actio depositi, which was bonae
fidei, interest was recoverable, whether due by agreement oron account
οἱ mora The communest illustration oi the contract is to be found in
banking; is money were deposited unsecured by key, seal, or other fast·
ening, it was presumed to be a depositum irregulare: ‘.. . . idem iuris
esse in deposito: nam si quis pecuniam numeratam ita deposuisset, ut
neque clausam neque obsignatam traderet, sed adnumeraret, nihil aliud
eum debere, apud quem deposita esset, nisi tantundem pecuniae solvere'
Dig. 19. 2. 3¹·

§ 4. As a source ol real rights, pignus hasbeen already discussed, p.
316 sq. supr. Justinian’s requirement oi exacta diligentia in the pledgee,
though irreconcileable with Gaius in Dig. 13. 6. 18. pr. (where only that
qualem in suis rebus, etc. is exacted), is confirmed by Ulpian and Paulus
in Dig. 13. 7. 13. 1; ib. 14. Some difficulty is occasioned by the word
‘sufficere 3’ possibly the jurist (perhaps Gaius) from whom the text was
derived, aster describing commodatum, and saying that the borrower was
answerable ior exacta diligentia, went on ‘in pledge, on the other hand,
it is sufficient that the pledgee.should be as careiul as in suis rebus ;’
and the compilers oi the Institutes, while altering the degree oi diligentia
to agree with Ulpian and Paulus, omitted to alter sufficere into some such
word as requiri (Schrader).

The chief other duties oi the pledgee were (1) to return the property
pledged when the debt was paid, or the ius pignoris otherwise deter-
mined. The general rule too is that he must either give up to the
pledgor all the fruits or other profit derived from the property, or deduct
their value from the amount oi the debt, Dig. 13. 7. 22. pr. : buton this
point there was osten some special agreement, e. g. antichresis. (2) 1t he
exercised the right ot' sale, he was bound to hand over to the pledgor only
what remained after discharging the principal debt with interest, unless
by his own fault he sold it ior less than its real value ι in which case he
was liable to pay the difference himself.

The possible duties to which the pledgor might becom'e liable ex post
facto correspond to those which have been noticed under commodatum :
be was also bound (1) to discharge all debts which the pledgee might
incur in his efforts to sell the property at the highest possible price,
Dig. 13. 7. 22. 43 (2) to deliver it up when required ior sale, ir it had
