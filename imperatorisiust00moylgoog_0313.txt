298 INS TIT UTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [hihll.

3Cum autem ratio legis Falcidiae ponitur, ante deducitur aes
alienum, item funeris impensa et pretia servorum manu·
missorum, tunc deinde in reliquo ita ratio habetur, ut ex eo
quarta pars apud heredes remaneat, tres vero partes inter
legatarios distribuantur, pro rata-scilicet portione eius, quod
cuique eorum legatum fuerit. itaque si fingamus quadrin-
gentos aureos legatos esse et patrimonii quantitatem, ex
qua legata erogari oportet, quadringentorum esse, quarta
pars singulis legatariis detrahi debet. quodsi trecentos
quinquaginta legatos fingamus, octava debet detrahi. quodsi
quingentos legaverit, initio quinta, deinde quarta detrahi
debet: ante enim detrahendum est, quod extra honorum
quantitatem est, deinde quod ex bonis apud heredem re·
manere oportet.

the opposite case the rule was inconsistent: if banknrpt debtors subse·
quently acquired property, the legatees were so much the better off, Dig.
ib. 5⁶· r.

The heir was entitled to his fourth as heir: whatever else he got from
the testator, by legacy, fideicommissum, or donatio mortis causa, was not
included in it, unless the testator directed otherwise, Dig. ib. 56. 5.

5 8. Besides debts, funeral expensas, and the value of slaves whom the
testator had manumitted either directly or by fideicommissum, there
were deducted the costs of administrantium Dig. 32. 5. 72. The heir could
not claim his legitima pars (Tit. 18 supr.) in addition to the Falcidiae
fourth: the Canon law altered this where he was charged with a fidei·
commissaria hereditas (for which see next Title). The legitima pars of

those relations of the testator who could claim it was treated as adebt
due from the inheritance.

The cases in which the heir could not claim the Falcidian fourth are
briefly as follow. (1) Where the testament was that of a soldier exe·
cuted in accordance with the rules laid down in Tit. 11 supr, Cod. 6. 21.
12. (2) Where the testator explicitly denied the fourth to the heir, which
Justinian enabled him to do in all cases by Nov. 1. a. 2. (3) Where the
heir renohnced the right, such renunciation being presumed if he pald
the legacies in full, Cod. 6. sot 19: but no such renunciation bound the
heir if made during the testatore lifetime, Dig. 32. 5. 15. 1. (4) Where
the heir forfeited his right, as he did (a) by neglecting to make an inven-
tory (p. 277 supr), Cod. 6. 3α 22. 4, (b) by any attempt to defraud the
legatees, Dig. 32· 5. 59. pn: and (c) by accepting the inheritance only
under compulsion from the legatees or fideicommissarii, Dig. 36. r. 4:
ib. ¹4· 4. (5) The right to deduct the fourth did not exist in respect of
certain kinds of legacies, eg. those of liberty to slaves, Dig. 32· 5. 33,
