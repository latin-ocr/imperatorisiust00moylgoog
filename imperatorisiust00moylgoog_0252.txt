Tit. 10.] DE TESTAMENTIS ORDINANDIS. 237

non erant necessaria. Sed cum paulatim tam ex usu homi-3
num quam ex constitutionum emendationibus coepit in unam
consonantiam ius civile et praetorium iungi, constitutum est,
ut uno eodemque tempore, quod ius civile quodammodo
exigebat, septem testibus adhibitis et subscriptione testium,
quod ex constitutionibus inventum est, et ex edicto praetoris
signacula testamentis imponerentur: ut hoc ius tripertitum ’
esse videatur, ut testes quidem et eorum praesentia uno con·
textu testamenti celebrandi gratia a iure civili descendant,
subscriptiones autem testatoris et testium ex sacrarum con·
stitutionum observatione adhibeantur, signacula autem et
numerus testium ex edicto praetoris. Sed his omnibus ext
nostra constitutione propter testamentorum sinceritatem, ut
nulla fraus adhibeatur, hoc additum est, ut per manum testa·
toris vel testium nomen heredis exprimatur et omnia secundum
illius constitutionis tenorem procedant.

Tit. 9·2 inf, Ulpian, reg. 28.12. What he could, and did, do was to
say that if the person named as heir in the informal will applied to him, ·
he would award him the bonorum possessio (ie bonitarian ownership,
Gaius iii. 80) on condition of his executing the directions therein con·
tained, and would protect himin that possession by special remedies
until usucapio had converted it into ownership : the bonorum possessor
‘loco heredis constituitur' Gaius loc. cit. : he is ‘velut heres' Dig. 5. 5. 1.
But the praetor would never uphold such wllls in favour of an extraneus
heres against a suus heres claiming ab intestato, nor even against agnates
who advanced the same title until M. Aurelius, who enabled the scriptus
heres to repel their action by exceptio doli, Gaius ii. 120. 'ibe gradual
development of bonorum possessio into a supplementary scheme of suc·
cession by the side of the hereditas is sketehed in an Excursus at the end
of Bln iii.

lh. This is usually called testamentum tripertitum. The enactment
that witnesses must sign as well as seal seems to have been as old
as Ulpian, who writes ‘si quis nomen non adscripserit . . .pro eo est atque
si adhibitus non esset’ Dig. 28, 1. 224: the constitution of Theodosius ll
in Cod. 6. 23. 21 was only arepetition. The same emperor required that
the testator must either sign the document, or have it signed for him by
an eighth witness if unable to write himself. lf, however, the whole will

. was expressly stated upon its face to be written hy his own hand, bis

signatore was unnecessary (testamentum holographum, Cod. 6. 23. 28. 1).

§4. Justinian subsequently repealed this mle, which ls found in Cod.
⁶. ²3 29 by Nov. rto 9. A SC. Libonianum of the ,time of Tiberius had
enacted that if one man wrote out a will for another, any disposition
which it contained in bis own favour should be void: later an edictum of
