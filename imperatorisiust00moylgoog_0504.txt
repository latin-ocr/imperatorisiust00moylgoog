INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV. Ι 489

It is pointed out that a wrong ol this sort may be inflicted upon one
in the person of one's wiie, children, or slaves; for though the slave
himself has no rights whatever, and therefore no good name to inJure,
yet the object oi an attack upon him may be to dishonour his master.
The penalty sor this offence, originally in some cases retaliatory, had
been altered by the praetor to a pecuniary mulct‚ which the injured
person was allowed within certain limita to fix himself 5 the considera-
tione upon which its amount depended were in the main his rank and
the circumstances turder which the injury bad been inflicted, which
would sometimes bring it within the category ol iniuria atrox. Among
minor points touched upon in the text are the bearing ol the lex
Cornelia upon this subject, the alternative crimina] remedy, the lia-
bility ol accessories and instigatore, and the extinction oi the actio
iniuriae by dissimulatio or condonation.

The fifth Title illustrates the class of obligations which arise quasi
ex delicto, and which seem mainly to be cases of vicarious responsi·
bility‚ such as that ol a householder ior damage caused by things
‘effusa et deiecta’ irom his residence‚ and of an inn or stable keeper
ior the delicts of his employlr. The reason why a judge was held
liable quasi ex delicto lor loss occasioned to suitors by his incapacity
or injustice would seem only to be that such an oflence could not
be brought within the definition ol any ol the lour old established
Delicts.

At Title 6 we enter upon the discussion of the last department os
Private Law-the ius quod ad actiones pertinet. The division oi law
into law ol Persons and law of Things is perhaps as old as Cicero
(lavent. i. 24), and apparently was the basis ol aclassiiication in the
Perpetual Edict (Dig. i. 5. a) ; but Gaius, so lar as we know, was the
first jurist who added the third division os actiones. It may be
doubted whether his own conception ol this branch ol his system was
as clear as a more modern writer might have made it. The term
actio, as is shown in the note on Tit. 6. pr., has a variety ol meanings
in the writings of the Roman lawyers, and two oi them seem to be
more or less blended in Gaius’ fourth Book, which wholly relates to
this topic. Inone sense, actio is a right of action; and a treatise
upon rights of action would correspond with what writers on analy-
tical Jurisprudence term the Law of Sanctioning or Remedial
rights. In another sense actio means the Procedure in an action;
taken thus, the ius quod ad actiones pertinet would correspond to
what the same writers call Adjective Law, and which it is perhaps
more proper to regard as a part ol the Public rather than oi the
