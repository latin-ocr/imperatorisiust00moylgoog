20 Quaedam actiones mixtam eausam optinere videntur tam
iurem quam in personam. qualis est familiae erciscundae
actio, quae competit coheredibus de dividenda hereditate:
item communi dividundo, quae inter eos redditur, inter quos
aliquid commune est, ut id dividatur: item finium regun-
dorum, quae inter eos agitur qui confines agros habent. in
quibus tribus iudiciis permittitur iudici rem alicui ex litiga·
toribus ex bono et aequo adiudicare et, si unius pars praegra-
vari videbitur, eum invicem certa pecunia alteri condemnare.

21 Omnes autem actiones vel in simplum conceptae sunt vel
in duplum vel in triplum vel in quadruplum: ulterius autem

pose os assessing the damages, and it the value os the slave killed (e. g.)
had not been higher in the preceding year than at the actual moment of
his death. For legaeies ad pias causas ct'. p. 445 supr. and § 26 inf.

ξ 20. The functions os the judge in the iudicia divisoria are more sully
described in Tit. 17. 4-6 ins. The explanation of their being partly real,
partly personal, must be sought in the structure ol their formula in the
earlier period This seems to have contained two intentiones, the first
in rem concepta, and followed by an adiudicatio (‘quantum adiudicari
ex aequo et bono oportet iudex Titio adiudicato' Gaius iv. 42), the second
concepta in personam, and followed by a condemnatio (eg. tum quicquid
ob eam rem alterutrum alteri dare facere oportet ex fide bona, eius iudex
alterum alteri condemnato). Mutatis mutandis, the whole formula was
repeated lor each ot the parties (e. g. each joint owner), whence Ulpian
calls these actions mixtae in another sense : ‘mixtae actiones, in quibus
uterque actor est’ Dig. 44. 7. 37. 1. Under Justinian they are in reality
in personam only, arising quasi ex contractu, Bk. iii. 27. 3 supr. : ‘linium
regundorum aetio in personam est, licet pro vindicatione rei est' Dig.
ro. 1. r.

The last named aetion, which was as old as the Twelve Tables, aud
had been regulated by a lex Mamilia and enactments ol Constantine,
Valentinian ll. and Theodosius l, was in Justinian's time limited to
disputes as to the boundaries ol praedia rustica, Dig. ιο. 1. 4. 103 the
judge was assisted by experts (agrimensores) as assessore, and neither
party could plead usucapio unless it had extended to thirty years

§²1- The expression in simplum, in duplum etc. concepta, which
refers to the condemnatio, is another trace os the survival ol the formula
in the later procedure. Where a plaintill' sues sor ‘id quod sua interest'
the aetion is in simplum concepta, though the amount of this may sar
exceed the verum rei pretium, Dig. 19. r. ¹³· pr. ‘Ulterius (quam in
quadruplum) nulla actio extenditur’ means no more than that in no
action does the law direct tbe recovery of more than four times the
penal unit; lor sometimes the penalty will bave no lixed relation to the
value ol the object, and so as a fact will be more than lourlold that value
