animalia, quae in terra mari caelo nascuntur, simulatque ab
aliquo capta suerint, iure gentium statim illius esse incipiunt:
quod enim ante nullius est, id naturali ratione occupanti con·

fundo quisque capiat, an in alieno: plane qui in alienum lun·
dum ingreditur venandi aut aucupandi gratia, potest a domino,
si is providerit, prohiberi ne ingrediatur. quidquid autem

Bk. iv. 6. 4 ini.) no less than against the rest ot' the world, the transferes,
as bona fide possessor, has the actio Publiciana lor the recovery os the
property ir taken out oi his hands. Other cases of ‘bonitarian’ owner·
ship, though less common than this, sprang up lrom the praetorias legal
innovations, e. g. those ol praetorian universal succession in bankruptcy
and upon death: in these the proper remedy was some other fictitious
action <Gaius iv. 35).

ln the time ol Gaius this distinction between dominium ex iure Quiri·
tium and in bonis habere is of every-day occurrence, but, except in
respect of manumission (note on Bk. i. 5. 1 supr), the differences between
them are not of any practical importance. When Justinian had abolished
the old points of difference between solum Italicum and solum pro-
vinciale (Tit. 6 pr. ini, Cod. 7. 3¹3 5. 13'. ις), and peregrini had practi-
cally become unknown, all these refinements disappeared: there was
hutone dominium leit; the only contrast was between it and possessio.
The survival ol the actio Publiciana in the Corpus iuris is explained by
Mt. Poste, Gaius p. 188.

Some ot' the modes in which ownership is acquired in res singulae are
common to most systema of law: others are peculiar to this people or
that. The former the Romans supposed to have been prescribed or
sanctioned hy the law os nature, and therefore to be prior in time
(vetustius ius) to those which are peculiar: ior a peculias mode oi ac·
quisition exists only in virtue of municipal law or custom, which is itself
the outcome ol political society, and political association was preceded
in their view (derived from the Stoics, p. 3⁶ supr.) by ages in which
nature’s was the only law, and civitates, magistratus, and leges had not
yet come into existence. lt is hardly necessary to observe that this
view is quite erroneous: the history oi Roman law alone might cou-
vince us that among primitive peoples absolute private ownership isa
thing at first unknown, and that when it has been developed, alienation
is the exception, not the rule, and the modes in which it is effected
formal and essentially ‘iuris civilis!
