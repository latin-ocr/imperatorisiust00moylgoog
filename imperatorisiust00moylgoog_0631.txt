we lind awell marked divergence. One alternative ‘consists in toler-

courts. but in all other cases it is treated as awilsul breach ol the ,
peace. The other is the incorporation oi distraiut with a regular

lirst step, we may say, in tbe process by which seli-redress slowly
yielded to the encroachments os courts oi justice was the gradual
development ol a body ol curtum, in some cases extremely bully,
precisely defining the conditione under which it might be exacted,
and minutely prescribing the proper stages in the process, without the
due observance of which the complainant must altogether lose his
remedy. Notice of the intentionto distrain-‹lasting upon the wrong.

between the earlier and later steps-and many other formalities are,
or may be, the essential conditione ol success. Such limitation by
⁴custom of the right ol seli-redress-in other words, its ‘incorporation
with a regular procedure '-is most common in societies, such as that
of the lrish as revealed to us in the Brehon law tracta, in which, even
il there be a judicial system at all, its action is weak and intermittent,
or where ‘courts os justice exist less lor the purpose of doing right
universally than lor the purpose ol supplying an alternative to the

’ violent redress ol wrong.¹ But ‘the Roman tribunals became the
organs ol the national sovereignty at an exceptionally early date,
and the development ol-Roman law and procedure was exceptionally
rapid ;' consequently, we are enabled to bridge over the guli between
the primitive system ol private vengeance, and the earliest Roman
civil process ol which we have any knowledge, less by tracing this
gradual incorporation uf seli-redtess with a regular procedure than
by other indicatione ol more advanced ideas. These in the main are
three in number: the introduction and development ol the idea ol
composition lor injury; the plan oi guaranteeing a man's rights by
collective action through svitnesses3 and the contractual decision ol
disputes.

i. There can be little doubt that the term ‘poena’ originally meant
not so much penalty as composition lor injury; the earliest poenae
were sums in consideration ol which the injured person consented to
lorego his customary right ol seli-tedress, and the penal sumere·
