290 INST IT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. 11.

stitutionem incertus dari debeat, quia certo iudicio debet quis
28 pro tutela suae posteritati cavere. Postumus autem alienus
heres institui et antea poterat et nunc potest, nisi in utero
eius sit, quae iure nostra uxor esse non potest. Si quid in
29 nomine cognomine praenomine legatarii erraverit testator, si
de persona constat nihilo minus valet legatum: idem in

Tit. 14. pr. supr. The constitution by which Justinian altered the law is
not in the Code which has come down to us, but there is a statement oi
its contents in the abstract oi the Basilica made by one Tipucitus

ξ 28. What Justinian says as to the possibility of instituting a postumus
alienus before his own time refers (as is clear from Bk. iii. ᾳ pr. ini.) not
to the validity os such institution iure civili, but to tbe resulting bonorum
possessio: cl. Gaius ii. 242, 287. For the latter part of tbe section cs.

, Gaius ii. ¹41 ‘item qui in utero eius est quae connubio non interveniente

ducta est uxor extraneus postumus patri contingit’ and Dig. 28. no 1
‘sed si ex ea, quae alii nupta sit, postumum quis heredem instituerit,
ipso iure non valet, quod turpis sit institutio,’ ib. 4 ‘sed si per adop·
tionem sororem iactam habeam, potero postumum ex ea heredem in·
stituere, quia adoptione soluta possum eam ducere uxorem! Ι

§2⁸. Mistake is of two kinds: it may exist either in forming an in·
tention‚ or in expressing one¹ already genuinely formed. In this and the
next section Justinian is speaking oi the latter. An error in a name, si de
persona constat, does not affect the validity of a testamentary disposition,
‘rerum enim vocabula immutabilia sunt, hominum mutabilia’ Dig. 30
4 pr. Again, it a testator expressed a different quantity t'rom what be
intended, the expression must yield to the intention, Dig. 28. 5. 9. 2-4;
3015: and is he inserted a condition which he never intended, it was
taken pro non scripto, Dig. 28. 5. 5: but a disposition which in form is
absolute, but which the testator intended to make conditional, is void, Dig.
&595

A disposition made under a mistake, or in ignorance os certain facts
(the first kind of mistake above mentioned) as a rule has all the effect
which it would have had, had there been no mistake at all. In wills,
however, this rute is reversed, and the disposition is void. Thus, iia
testator institutes or gives a legacy to a person whom he erroneously
believes to be his son or brother, the institution or legacy is invalid, Cod
6. 23. 5 ; 6. 244 7: so too if he institutes an extraneus supposing that
he has no children of his own, Dig. 5. 2. 28, οι executes a second will
under the impression that the person instituted in the first is dead,
Dig. 28. 5. 92. According to this rule, the master of the instituted slave
in Tit. 15. 4 supr. would be entitled to nothing, but the decision ot
Tiberius, though quite opposed to principle, is to be excused as a rougb
and ready attempt to adjust a condiet between equitable and strictly
legal claims. The inconsistency between ἐξ 4 and ιι has been pointed
out in the note on the latter.
