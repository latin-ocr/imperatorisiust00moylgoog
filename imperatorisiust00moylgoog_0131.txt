dicionibus vendere, ut pretium dominis daretur, et recte:
expedit enim rei publicae, ne quis re sua male utatur. cuius

DE PATRIA POTESTATE. ·

citizen anda woman with whom he had connubium were born in his
potestas; and unless he died first, or they were voluntarily released by
him, they remained under it, with trilling exceptions, to the day of their
death. The peculiarity oi this, as compared with other peoples, is
noticed by many writers (Gaius i. 5 5 ; ci. Sextus Empir. Pyrrhon iii. 24
οἵ re Ῥωμαίων νομοθέται τοὺς παῖδας ὑποχειρίους καὶ δούλους τῶν ποτέρων
κελεύουσιν εἶναι . . . παρ’ ἑτέροις δὲ ὡς τυραννικὸν τοῦτο ἐκβέβλητοι, Servius
ad Verg. Aen. xi. 143 ‘filii in potestate patris.. . servi loco’). What is
strange about it is not so much its stringency, as its survival, through
centuries oi legal history, to the time os Justinian, and its deliberate
perpetuation in his legislation. This is explained in some degree ογ the
Roman aversion to any change in old established custom which the
advance in social conditione did not render absolutely necessary3 still
more by the fact that the patria potestas of the sixth century oi our own
era was a very different institution from that oi the earlier period; the
rights oi the father over the personui the child had been largelycurtailed
by both law and custom, and by the development oi the different kinds
ol peculium (Bk. ii. 9. 1, and notes, ini), the position of the son in
respect ol property and contract had been largely assimilated to that oi
