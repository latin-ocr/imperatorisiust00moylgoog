two comitia, with their respective iunctions, still remained perlectly
distinct, but the centuries had been incorporated with the tribes;
Cicero (pro Planc. ao) expressly speaks ol thern as thus incorporated,
and in another passage alludes to the votes ol the tribes in his own

election as consul. The exact date ol this changeia uncertain. ' Ῑ

Niebuhr ascribes it to the censors Fabius and Decius; Mommsen
places it somewhat earlier. Its motive was apparently the desire to
reduce the influente ol moderate fortunes in the comitia, and to exalt
that os birth, lauded property, and military rank. The proprietary
qualification sor even the first ol the Servian classes had, through the
growing prosperity oi Rome, ceased to be the measure ol a consider·
able fortune or even the index of social respectability; thus a great mass
oi the lower middle class had sound its way into a body which Servius
had conceived as consisting ol only the higher or richer orders. The
same observation may be made of the second and succeeding
classes; the social position ol the members ol this or that class bad
altered along with the change in the value oi money, and the relative
rank in the state of those who composed class one, and who, as we
have seen, formed a political force oi overwhelming influence, had
iallen in proportion ; the timocratic constitution remained the same,
while money had corneto be worth less; the result being a complete
change in the political centre ol gravity. The natural remedy seemed
to be to give up, at any rate partially, the timocratic system, to di·
minish the number ol the centuriae, whereby the induente ol the
equestrian order would be increased, and to bring them into a sub·
ordinate relation with the tribeS, in whose assembly the politicab
preponderance lay rather with the landed proprietors. These at least
appear to be the general lines os the reforming policy. Though the
exact changes are mereor less matter oi conjecture, the best theory
os them seems to be that, while the old equestrian centuries, eighteen
in number, were lest untouched those ol the five Servian classes were
distributed among the tribes and at the same time reduced in number,
there being liity-sour centuries in the rusticae, eight in the urbanae
tribus; so that the whole number oi centuries would now be eighty.
The classes still voted in their old order, but speaking generally,
were, so far as related to the comitia, no longer determined by a pro·
perty qualification. The right of a citizen to vote in the comitia
centuriata depended on his being enrolled in a tribe, and to what
tribe he belonged was settled by the consors. By the year a. c. 241,

the number ol tribes had by successive additions been raised to thirty·
five.
