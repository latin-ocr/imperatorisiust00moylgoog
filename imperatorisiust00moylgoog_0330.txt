IURA IN RE ALIENA OTHER THAN SERVITUDES. 315

entitled to cvict him il he allowed the condition of the land to dcte·
riorate, Nov. rao. 8. From payment ol his rent he was exempted
only by complete destniction of the land (Bk. iii. 24. 3 ini, Cod.
4. 66. 3). Should he propose to sell his interest, the dominus had,
within two months, a right os pre-emption (ius προτιμήσεως) at the
price agreed upon: the person of the alienee had to be approved by
the latter, who, however, could only reluse his sanction on reasonable
grounds, The modes in which emphyteusis arose are identical with
those ior the creation ol superficies, and the doubt as to the admissi·
bility ol usucapio applies to both.

The mention os pignus, the last -ol the three iura in re aliena which
are not servitudes‚ makes this ¹the mostconvenient place sor discussing
the different sonus which pledge or mortgage took in Roman law.
The object ol pledge is to give a creditor a real security in addition
to the personal security of his debtor. Il the creditor relies sor
satisfaction ol his debt solely on a general belles in his debtor's ability
and willingness to meet his liabilities, he contents himself with a per-
sonal security, and ifthc debtors assets prove insufficient, he must
pro tanto be a loser: but il' by any means he obtains rights over some
definite portion ol the debtor's property, to which he can resort in
the event ol non-payment, his security is real, ‘quia expedit ei pignon’
potius incumbere quam in personam agere' Blr. iv. 1. r4ini. Real
security, in short, is a means of protecting a creditor against the risk
ol the debtoffs insolvency: lor creditors who are only ‘personally’
secured have no rights against the specific property to which the
‘really' secured creditor can resort until the latter has been paid in
tull. Bearing this in mind, it is clear that that form os real security
is the most satisfactory which, while it absolutely secures the creditor,
causes the least inconvenience in other ways to the parties concemed.
Itis important to observe how lar these conditions respectively are
satisfied hythe different forms os real security known to the Roman
lawyers, and also how lar these themselves belong to the department
of iura in re aliena.

The earliest form was that known as fiducia, a term which here
bears the same meaning as in connection with deposit, emancipation,
and coemption, the general idea being that of a conveyance under an
agreement ol trust, whereby the transferee is laid under an obligation
to deal with the person or property conveyed to him in a particular
manner. The aim ol real security was obtained by the debtor's
conveying specific property (it res mancipi, by mancipation, if nec
mancipi, by in iure cessio) to the creditor, upon terms that the latter
