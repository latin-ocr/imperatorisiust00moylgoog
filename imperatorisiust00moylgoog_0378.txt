In summa quod ad bona libertorum admonendi sumus
senatum censuisse, ut quamvis ad omnes patroni liberos, qui
eiusdem gradus sint, aequaliter bona libertorum pertineant,
tamen liceret parenti uni ex liberis adsignare libertum, ut post
mortem eius solus is patronus habeatur, cui adsignatus est, et
ceteri liberi, qui ipsi quoque ad eadem bona nulla adsignatione
interveniente pariter admitterentur, nihil iuris in his bonis
habeant. sed ita demum pristinum ius recipiunt, si is cui
adsignatus est decesserit nullis liberis relictis. ’ Nec tantum1
libertum, sed etiam libertam, et non tanturn filio nepotive,
sed etiam filiae neptive adsignare permittitur. Datur autem2
haec adsignandi facultas ei, qui duos pluresve liberos in
potestate habebit, ut eiS, quos in potestate habet, adsignare
ei libertum libertamve liceat. unde quaerebatur, si eum cui

to alibertus civis invariably descended to the patrons' children ; that os
taking the property os a Latinus belonged to his heres (Gaius iii. 58) : a
libertus civis was succeeded by joint patrons in equal shares, though
before his manumission they might have owned him in unequal propor-
tions: ‘bona vero Latinorum pro ea parte pertinent pro qua parte quis·
que eorum dominus fuit' (Gaius ib. 59). One patron ot' a civis excluded
another patron’s son, and so on, but the property ol a Latinus went to
one patron and another patron’s heir in the ratio in which it would have
belonged to the two patrons (ib. 60); between joint patrous of a civis
there was accrual, ‘bona autem Latini pro parte decedentis patroni
caduca fiunt et ad populum pertinent’ (ib. 62). The SC. Largianum, nn.
42, enacted that where the patronos a latinus instituted an extraneus
heres, the right of taking his property upon his decease should belong to
the patron’s children so sar as they were not expressly disinberited,
Gaius ib. 67-71. For the attainment of civitas by a Latinus ex beneficio
Ι principis, to which the edict of Trajan related, cf. Gaius iii. 72, Ulpian, ·
reg. 3. 2, and Mr. Poste's notes on Gaius i. 28-3 5.

The late oi the property of a deceased dediticius libertus had depended
upon the mode olbis manumission. If it had been such as would have
made him a civis, were it not ior the ‘vitium’ owing to which he
necessarily became dediticius (p. 109, supra), the property devolved as '
though he actually were a civis libertus: is, except forme disqualification,
it would have made him a Latinus, it devolved as though he actually .
were a Latinus, Gaius iii. 74-76.
