THE ROMANS AND THE IUS GENTIUM· 35

suppose that he first heard the allegatione of the parties, and then
fixed the issue to he tried iu written instructions, which were delivered
to the recuperatores or to the single iudex whom he appointed, and to
whom the decision of the case was committed.

'Ihe law which, under the superintendence of the praetor peregrinus,
these judges administered, was of course, in origin, the same which
the recuperatores had always applied in the decision of actions which
were brought before them. But it now assumed a more consistent
aud permanent character by being embodied in the new praetor’s
edict Its steady growth was thus assured, no less than through the
activity of leading citizens themselves who became connected with
foreign towns or districts in the Roman dominions hythe tieof patron
and client, and who, iu this relation, toolu a lively interest in the de-
velopment of this new branch of law. The mode in which the praetor ·
peregrinus gradually elaborated a tolerably complete body of rules
by which actions between citizens and foreigners, or foreigners only,
should be decided‚ has been variously represented. Sir Henry Maiue
(Ancient Law p. 48 sq.) seems to adopt the view of those who hold
that he compared the usages of the various Italian nations with whom
Rome was acquainted, and by this conscious and deliberate process
collected a system of principles which the maiority of peregrini en-
gaged in commerce pn Roman territory with citizens or with one
another, would recognise as binding: ‘naturalia iura quae apud omnes
gentes peraeque servantur' (lnst. i. a. ιι). But this seems an instance
of the common error of ascrihing scientific habits to a prescientific
period, and the eclectio process implies a mental constitution which
was not common among the Romans. It is true that this view is not
unsupported by some dicta of the Roman jurists themselves; hut
these, we must remember, wrote at a time when the treatment of law
had passed from the empirical to the scientific stage, and their
evidence is therefore the less trustworthy. lt would seem more
probable that this body of law on'ginated in a practical necessity¹‚
which, though slight at first, became gradually more aud more press-
ing, and that it grew with that necessity, its development being acci-
deutal and due to circumstances, though effected under the fostering
care of the praetor peregrinus ; rather than that it sprang into exist-
ence, so to speah, uno ictu, as the result of a conscious comparison cf
Italau usages. This body of law, however, whatever may have been
its precise origin, was what the Romans knew as the ius gentium a
