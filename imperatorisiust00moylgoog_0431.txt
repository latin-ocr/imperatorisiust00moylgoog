practical incapacity of women to enter into contracts ol this kind as
promisors. lt seems to have originated in edicta of Augustus and
Claudius, prohibiting wives from becoming sureties sor their husbands,
Dig. 16. 1. 2. pr. lt is supposed, with considerable probability, that the
cause ol the more general enactment, the SC. Velleianum,n.1). 64, was
recklessness with which women, after Claudius had abolisbed the tutela
legitima ol agnatos over them (p. 140 supr), exercised their newly-sound
control os their property on behall of others. This enacted that no action
should lie on contracts of suretyship entered into by women as promisors ;
‘quod ad fideiussiones et mutui dationes pro aliis pro quibus interces-
serint leminae pertinet, tametsi ante videtur ita ius dictum esse, ne eo
nomine ab his petitio neve in eas actio detur, cum eas virilibus officiis
fungi et eius generis obligationibus obstringi nonsit aequum ; arbitrari
senatum, recte atque ordine facturos ad quos de ea re in iure aditum erit,
si dederint operam ut in ea re senatus voluntas servetur' Dig. 16. 1. a.
The senatusconsult thus related only to fideiussio and mutuum; but its
principle was extended to all forms os intercessio, privative as wellas
cumulative, by responsa ol the jurists and imperial enactments, Dig.
loc. cit. 1. pr., iba. 4. 'lbough it had refused a remedy on such con·
tracts‚ it would seem that the usual practice was for the praetor to grant
the action, is applied lor, which could then be met by the exceptio SC1.
Velleiani, frequently mentioned in the texts, which could be pleaded
against execution even after judgment had been given, Dig. 14. 6. 11. lt
must not, however, be inserted from this that the woman incurred even a
‘natural' obligation to pay the debt; lor is she paid in ignorance of her
right to the exceptio, she could recover by condictio indebiti, Dig. 12. 6.
46 pr. Another view as to the history os the matter, in some degree
supported by the terms of the senatusconsult, is that women had been
forbidden to become sureties even by the old civil law, and that the
enactments ol the time of Augustus and Claudius are merely evidence of
its evasion through the rapid decay os old Roman manners at the close
of the Republic.

There are a number os exceptions from the operation ol the senatus·
consult, as e. g. where the woman had been guilty os dolus towards the
creditor, Dig. 16. 1. 2. 3, and where the latter, through no fault olbis own,
was not aware that the person ‘interceding' was a woman, ib. 123 where
the intercessio was made sor valuable consideration, Cod. 4. 29. 23. pr. ς
where the debr lor which she interceded was practically her own; and
where the creditor was a minor and the principal debtor insolvent, Dig. ⁴-
4. 12.
