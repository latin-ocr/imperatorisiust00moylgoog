24. 2. 2. 1. Persons, however, who had been married by confarreatio
could be separated only by a religious form of divorce called diffarreatio.
lt seems uncertain, where manus was produced by usus or coemptio,
whether the wife was as free ‘repudium mittere’ as where she was not in
manu mariti, though Gaius says (i. 137) ‘a wife subject to manus can
no more compel her husband to release her therefrom without dissolution
of the marriage than a daughter can compel her father to emancipato
her! A special form was prescribed lor repudia (probably by the lex
Iulia de adulteriis, Β. c„ 17) which required the message to be delivered
by a freedman ol the family, in the presence of seven witnesses above
the age of puberty, and citizens of Rome, Dig. 24. a. 9.

'lhe recklessness with which the right ol divorce was exercised in the
darker days of the Empire is well known. For centuries the only
attempts made to check the evil consisted in imposing certain pro·

' prietary disadvantages on persons who unjustiliably divorced their con-

sorte, or who occasioned a divorce by their own infidelity. Thus a wife
whose adultery led to her dismissa} forfeited a sixth of her dos, and an
eighth for more venial offences ; and if there were children bom of the
marriage, the husband might retain for their benerit a sixth of the dos
for each, though the whole amount thus retained might not exceed a
half of the whole dos (¹ retentio propter liberoS,' Ulpian, reg. ἁ 9. sq.). A
husband who occasioned a divorce had to restore the dos either at once,
or at least before the whole time had elapsed for which, under ordinary
circumstances, he would have been entitled to enjoy it The acceptance
of Christianity as the State religion brought with it a large amount of
imperial legislation on this subject. On divorce by mutual consent no
restraint was imposed until Justinian (Novels, 117 10, and 134 11), as a
penalty forced the parties into the retirement of a religious house. Con-
stantine (Cod. 6. 13.1) enumerated the grounds on which repudiation
should be deemed justifiable, and additions to the list were made by his
successore. The penalties inflicted on the guilty parties, as fixed by
Honorius, were loss of dos and donatio propter nuptias respectively.
Repudiation without any such good reason was still more severely
punished with enforced retirement to a cloister, and forfeiture ol the
whole property in favour partly of the cloister, partly of the guilty person’s
statutory heirs, Nov. 134 11.

A few words are necessary on the proprietary relations of hus-
band and wife. If the latter passed in manum, of course such property
as she had went absolutely with her to the husband ; but if the marriage
was unaccompanied by manus, and the wife was not in potestas, her
property remained as completely under her own control, and as free
from that of her husband, as if she had never married at all. Yet the
Roman law imposed on the husband the burden of all domestic ex-
penses, and of the rearing of the issue3 and it was doubtless this
inequality which led to the institution of dos, which was a contribution
