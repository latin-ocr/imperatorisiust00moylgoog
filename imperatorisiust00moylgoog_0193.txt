1'78‘ INTRODUCTION TO BOOK II.

Tables-uti legassit super pecunia tutelave suae rei, ita ius esto—and
is expounded at length in Tities 10-25. Certain abnormal cases, in
which a person, though not owner, may, or, though owner, may not
alienate, are noticed in Tit. 8. But the bulk of the text relating to
dominium is taken up by the modes, natural and civil, original and
derivative, in which it may be acquired, the preponderance ol natural
over civil titles‚ as compared with the law ol Gaius' age, being par·
ticularly noteworthy. Tities 3-5 relate to the fragments ol ownership
called servitudes, which correspond very roughly to the easements
and profits ol English Law. Title 9discusses the question ol agency
in the acquisition oi ownership, and states the. changes which had
taken place since Gaius in the proprietary capacity ol filiifamilias;
here too we get a reference to Possession, which is not ¹treated in
extenso, but a knowledge oi its rules is presupposed in the Title on
Usucapio, and is supplied in an Excursus below.

The transition from modes ‘quibus res singulae adquinrntur' to
those ‘quibus adquiruntur per universitatem,' brings us to the law os
lnheritance; the mles which prescribe the devolution ol a man’s '
universitas iuris on his decease. This may take plaoe either ex
testamento or ab intestato: the exposition ol testamentary succession
occupies the remainder of the Book. Firstly (Title 10·)‚are described
the solemnities necessary lor the execution of a valid will, the
qualification‘ required in the witnesses taking up some considerable
space; but from these sonnalities soldiers, while on actual service,
are exempt, and Title rr points out the chief anomalies involved in
this exemption. InTitle 12 are stated the qualifications required in
the testator, such as puberty and ‘testamentiiactio,' and the special
precautions to be observed in the execution ol a blind man's vill are
alluded to. Four successive Titles then explain the most ordinary
contenta os a testament, viz. exheredation· of sui heredes whom
the testator wishes to exclude from all share in hia succession
(Title13); the institution ol the heres or universal successor (Title 14) ;
substitutione ‘vulgar’ (Title 15) and ‘pupillary’ (Title 16), ansvering .
in some degree to the remainders so familiar in English deeds and
wills. Title 17 enumerates the modes in which a testameut might
be or become void, such as original inlormality, revocation, sub-
sequent birth oia suus heres, and capitis deminutio os the testator:
and in Title 18 is discussed the querella inofficiosi testamenti, the right
of certain relatives ol the deceased to impeach and upset his will, lor
not having left them a certain minimum ol his property. The
