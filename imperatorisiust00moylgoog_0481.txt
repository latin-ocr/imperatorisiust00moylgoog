realized was the claim of another person. This cessio nominum
or actionum, as it was called, though it dispensed with the necessity
of the dehtor's assent, was. not only mdc, but faulty, especially if
made for valuable consideration. The appointmeut of. C, as A's
procurator, was governed by the usual rules of mandatum, and con-
sequently became void (Blr. iii. 26. 9 and ro) ifbefore action brought
either assigner or assignee died, or if the former revolred his com·
mission; there was no legal relation between assignes and debtor
until litis contestatio had been reached in proceedings taken hythe
former. At length this was obviated by the assignee's being allowed
to sue, not in the assignor’s name, but in bis own by actio utilis
(Dig. 3. 3. 55, Cod. 4. 15. ult, 6. 37. 28), which he was enabled by
gradual changes to do not only where he had been expressly ap·
pointed agent, but also in cases of a mere alienatory disposition.
Itis disputed whether the effect of the change was to make the ·
assignes sole creditor, or whether, 12 relation to the debtor, he did
not still legally continue 2 mere agent, enforclug by action in his own
name the right of another ; in other words, whether a genuine assign-
ment, by which the assignes simply and actually stepped into the
sboes of his assignor, who simultaneously dropped altogether out of
the matter, was recognised at any time in Roman law. This,
however, istoo minute and complicated a question to be entered
upon.

For such assignment uo form was prescribed. It oould be effected
(2) by any expression of intention, unless it was of such a legal cha·
racter as to be invalid unless accompanied by certain solemnities (e. g.
donatio, p. 224 supr.); (a)byjudicial sentence, e. gin an actio familiae
erciscundae, Dig. ro. a. 3. If a defendant were ordered to transfer
achose in action, the judge might add that unless the order were
obeyed the assignment should be taken to have actually been made,
(3) in pursuanoe of 2 general rule of law (cessio legis), eg. a person
who procures the rescission of a will by querella inofliciosi cau
recover legaeies paid by the testamentary heir, Dig. 5. 2. 8. 26;
19.1.13.25.

The following rules of assignment are deserving of notice, if only
for the close parallelism between some of them and those of English
law:

(r) Until the debtor has received notice of the assignment, he is at
liberty to treat the assigner as his true creditor3 thus he is released
by payment to him (‘ ille, cuius nomen tibi pignori datum est, nisi ei '
cui debuit solvit nondum certior a te de obligatione tua factus,
