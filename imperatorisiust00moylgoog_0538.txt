aestimata lite iudex hominem pecunia damnabat’ Gell. 20. ι. The pecu-

' niary penalties fixed by the Twelve Tables were 300 asses is the broken
bone were a free man’s, 150 il it were a slave’s; ior all other iniuriae
25 asses, Gaius loc. cit. That the grossest libel could be atoned for by
payment ol this small sum argues the old Romans to have been not over
sensitive to abuse, unless it took the form oi ribald songs, in which case
the penalty ol death, fustuarium supplicium, was ordained by the Twelve
Tables, Paul. sent. rec. 5. 4. 6: ci. Cic. de republ. 4. ιο, Tusc. 4. 2. After
the introduction oi the praetorian penalties, the sum to be paid in cases
oi atrox iniuria (ξ 9 inf.) was in Gaids' time practically fixed by the praetor,
Gaius iii. 224. That Justinian does not mention this is perhaps to be
accounted lor by supposing that atrox iniuria was usually proceeded
against either criminally, ξ ιο inf, or under the lex Cornelia, §sint The
praetorian action could be brought only within an annus utilis os the
commission oi the offence, Cod. 9. 35. 5, and condemnation entailed
infamia, Tit. 16. 2 inf. The right of action was extinguished by the
death either oi the person injured, or oi the delinquent, the wrong being
purely personal, Dig. 47. ro. 13. pr.; this oi course must be understood
to mean that the action was neither actively nor passively transmissible;
the former, perhaps, because in many cases more than one person could
sue on the same iniuria.

ὁ 8. Whether this lex Cornelia, passed by Sulla ae 81, was confined
to iniuriae, or was only a part of a larger statute, perhaps the lex Cornelia
de sicariis, Tit. 18. 5 ini, is doubtlu13 the former view is supported by
the iulness with which it seems to have treated iniuria, Dig. 47. ιο. 5.
6-8; 48. 2. 12. 4. Its original object in any case was the criminal pro·
secution oi the acts oi violence to which it related (‘ apparet igitur omnem
iniuriam, quae manu fiat, lege Cornelia contineri' Dig. 47. ιο. 5. pn), but
by gradual usage a civil action was developed under its provisions, which,
though its scope was less than that of the older praetorian remedy, had
the advantage ol being perpetua, i.e. not barred by lapse os a year:
‘etiam exlege Cornelia iniuriarum actio civiliter moveri potest, con-
demnatione aestimatione iudicis iacienda’ Dig. 47. ιο. 57. 1. The
criminal proceedings under this statute apparently went out ol use, Dig.

ς 9. Gaius (iii. 223) and Paulus (sent. rec. 5. 4 ro) do not mention the
position of the wound as sufficient to make an iniuria atrox.
