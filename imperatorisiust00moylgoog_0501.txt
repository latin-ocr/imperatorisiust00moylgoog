the agent had made on his behali. How iar this was altered hythe
praetor when the agent was his slave or filiusfamilias is explained
more sully in Bk. iv. Tit yinf. But where a shipowner (exercitor)
appointed any one, whether in his power or not, as captain (magister)
ol his ship, the praetor made him directly liable in tull, by actio exer·
citoria, upon all business contracta made by the magister as his agent,
e. g. insurances, loans lor repairs, etc, Bk. iv. 7. ains. The same
rule was applied by the praetor when one appointed another,
whether in one’s power or not, as one’s institor, i. e. to manages
trade or business lor one, e. g. as merchant, tailor, banker, etc. ; the
principal was made directly liable, by actio institoria, on all contracts
entered into hythe institor in the ordinary course of the business.
And eventually, il the contract which the agent made ior the principal
did not tall within the scope ol either ol these two remedies, the latter
was made directly liable in every case by the action called quasi·
institoria or institoria utilis, neither of which names, however, are
classical. Finally‚ if the agent exceeded his commission, and the
principa] was benefitcd by the unauthorized contract, he was directly
suable pro tanto by the praetorian action de in rem verso, Dig. 4. 3.
15 pr; 19. r. 13. 73 26. 9. 3. All four actions belong to the class
lrnown as actiones adiectitiae qualitatis, because they were subsidiary
or additional to the natural remedy against the true contracting party;
lor though by these changes the principal had been made directly
liable, the agent had not therefore been exonerated; the third party,
who contracted with him, had the option of suing whichever he
pleased, the agent by direct action on the contract, or the principal
by actio adiectitiae qualitatis, these two being in lact correi debendi;
‘est autem nobis electi0, utrum exercitorem an magistrum convenire
velimus' Dig. 14. r. r. 17, ‘item si servus meus navem exercebit, et
cum magistro eius contraxero, nihil obstabit quominus adversus ma·
gistnrm experiar actione, quae mihi vel iure civili vel honorario com·
petit: narn et cuivis alii non obstat hoe edictum, quominus cum
magistro agere possit: hoc enim edicto non transfertur actio sed
adicitur¹ Dig. ib. 5.1: and it does not seem to be true, as some
maintain, that the agent's liabilityceases assoon as he is no longer
agent, or is limited by the extentos the principal’s assets.
