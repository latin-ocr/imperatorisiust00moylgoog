condition 31 1133 condemnatio, introduced by the words ‘si non' or
an eqrdvalent; and its place in the formula is between the Intentio
and the Condemnati0. A simple illustration is found in the exceptio
pacti (Gaius iv. 116), e. g. Aulus owes Titius money, for which the
latter promises not to sue, and then newertheless brings his acti0n;
Aulus would repel him by the exceptio ‘si inter Aulum et Titium non
convenit ne 33 pecunia peteretur! The usual Roman classifrcatIons
31 exceptiones 333 noticed 13 the text (Bk. iv. 13) and commentary; the
answer to the question, in what classes of actions this peculiar rule
had the widest operation, depends on the character of the Intentio.
The more special and definite the Intentio, the more likely was it
that the defence would consist in the allegation ofa countervailing
right rather than in a direct traverse 31 1133 plaintiII’s 313133. 13 3331

exceptio bonae fidei iudiciis inest ;’ which may perhaps be expanded
into a general rule, that in bonae fidei actions defences by way 31
countervailing right need not be alleged in iure so far as they were
grounded on equity and bona fides, but only where they were based
