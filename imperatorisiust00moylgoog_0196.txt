INTRODUCTION TO BOOK ΙΙ. 181

other parts of the system, they must, in reason, be co-ordinated with
other facts from which the same kind ol legal relation, namely
obligation, arises. And from this point of view Mr. Hunter is him-
self inconsistent, sor he co-ordinates with contracta certain other
sources ol obligation, via quasi-contract, and what he calls Status,
while he omits delict from tbis connection altogether. Under Status,
aa a source os obligation, he groups the family relations ol husband
and wile, and parent and child 3 but the incorrectness of this had
been long before shown by Savigny (System§ 58), who remarks that
these relations, and that produced by contract or delict, are altogether
disparate; the latter being the partial and temporary subiection ol one
person to the will ol another, the former being permanent, and having
a content natural and moral as well as legal: its legal content being
not so much the persona} right against the other party as a real right
to non-disturbance by the world at large ¹.

Important changes had talen place in the law comprised in this
second Book since the time oi Gaius. ln respect of modes ol
acquisition the ius gentium had reaped another triumph3 in iure
cessio and mancipatio, the oldest titles ol the ius civile, which had
already become practically obsolete, were sormally abolished by
Justinian, who also swept away, in the train of the latter, a trouble·
some distinction and much antiquated learning. The simplification
of law effected hythe recognition of traditio or mere delivery as the .
universal mode of conveying res singulae is however perhaps no
more to be admired than Justinian’s masterly codification, or more
properly reform, of the law os Usucapio or Prescription, which had
hitherto consisted ol two different sets os rules, the one civil, the other
praetorias, whose divergence had been occasioned hythe absurd
survival oi the doctrine that provincial soil could not be owned by
private individuale. The great change in the proprietary rights of
filiifamilias, initiated under Constantine by the institution ol quasi-
castrense and adventitium peculium, was consummated by Justinian
himself 3 the survival of the patria potestas was thus made tolerable
hythe partial surrender ol one ol its most valuable privileges. The
direct acquisition os possession, and so os ownership through agents,
had been sanctioned by a constitution of Severus, based upon a con·
sensus among the J'urists, who in Gaius' dme had been divided upon
the question3 and the interests of mortgagors were carelully guarded
by Justinian's regulations as to the exercise ol powers ol sale and
ioreclosure. ln the law ol wills, spart from changes in their form,
