EXCURSUS IV. ⁴

’ ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF BONORUM POSSESSIO.

Tun most tenable theory upon this subject seems to be that its
germ is to be found in the judicial regulation of Possession as pre·
liminary to an hereditatis petitio, and that, as such, it was merely the
temporary right to represent the deceased until the suit was finally
decided. In support of this view, it is to be observed that hereditatis
petitio was a real action or vindicatio, tried originally by sacramentum,
later by formula petitoria or sponsio, of which a prominent feature
was the award of possession of the obJ'ect of litigation pending the
proceedings (vindiciarum datio, Gaius iv. 16,17), upon ¹which the
rute to be played by the two parties respectively, as plaintiff or
defendant, depended. This interim possession of an hereditas, the
original embryo of bonorum possessio, is called by Cicero hereditatis
possessio, an expression which survives even in Dig. 37. 1. 3. 1. In
an action for the recovery of an inheritance, which, being an uni-
versitas, a res incorporalis, could not be possessed, it was impossible
to determine the vindiciae in what was probably the usual manner,
viz. to avard them to the claimant who was in possession at the
commencement of the proceedings 3 accordingly, it is supposed that
the praetor decided the question here in favour of the party who
’ prima facie seemed to have the better title, ie. who produced in his
favour a prima facie valid testament (tabulas septem signis signa-
tas), or, if there were no will, the nearest intestate heir; cf. Cic. in
Verrem 11. lib. i. 44-46, from which it is clear that the two earliest
kinds of bonorum possessio were secundum tabulas and that of the
legitimi, ‘posteaquam ius praetorium constitutum est, semper hoc
iure usi sumus : si tabulae testamenti non proferrentur, tum, uti proxi·
mum quemque potissimum heredem esse oporteret, ita secundum
eum possessio daretur? Abonomm possessor so constituted could,
as representative for the time being of the deceased, use the interdict
quorum bonorum and fictitious actions for the recovery of his
property; though, if defeated in the hereditatis petiti0, he was bound
by praedes or by stipulation to restore everything, Gaius iv. 16. 90.
