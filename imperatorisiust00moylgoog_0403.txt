but binding only if accepted ; the form is preserved in Terence, Andr. 5.
4. 47 ‘Cha dos, Pamphile, est decem talenta; P. accipio ;’ on which we
have the commentary, ‘ille nisi dixisset accipio dos non esset: datio
enim ab acceptione confirmatur, nec potest videri datum id, quod non
acceptum :' cf. Seneca, controv. 1. 6 ‘quidam dictas non accepere dotes’
Votum was a mere promise (pollicitatio) made for a religious purpose, or
in favour ofa church or pious foundation, Dig. 4. 12. 2. Lastly, a freed·
man on manumission could effectually bind himself to certain services to
his patron by mere oath, Dig. 38. r. 7, which between ordinary persons
imposed no actionable obligation whatever: cf. Tit. ro. 1 and note supr.

But the verbal contract κατ’ ἐξοχὴν is stipulation, a unilateral disposition
in which the promisor bound himself by returning an oral, affirmative
answer to the oral question of the promisee (stipulator), Cic. pro Caec. 3.
lts essence lies, at any rate in the later periods of Roman law, not in
the necessity of observing prescribed forms of words, but in the sub·
stantial correspondente between question and answer, and in the formal
requirement of the presence of both parties: see on Tit. 19. 12 inf. This
is uo special kind of contract, differing from others iu the sense in which
sale differs from hire, or deposit from pledge ; it is only a universal form
into which any conceivable agreement can be thrown, and into which
they frequently were thrown (eveu though actionable in themselves, e. g.
sale, apart from the form) on account of the great superiority to creditors
which stipulatiou possessed over the real and consensual contracts, except
mutuum, in the nature of the action by which it could be enforced. That
action, as is said in the text, was condictio: ‘the short and sharp remedy’
(as Mr. Poste calls it) ‘which, when brought for certa pecunia credita,
was the more lormidable to a dishonest litigant, as it was accompanied
hya sponsio poenalis, whereby the vanquislred party forfeited a third of
the sum in litigation, in addition, if he was defendant, to the original
'claim' The action on the real and consensual contracts, on the other
hand, was bonae fidei, and in many points favoured the defendant: see
on Blc iv. 6. 28 infr. For the difference between condictio certi, condictio
triticaria, and actio ex stipulatu, see Gaius iv. 136, and references s. v.
‘condictio’ in the General index.

lhering (ξ 46. note 747) considers Justinian’s derivation of stipulatio
from stipulum, in the sense of ‘firm,’ ‘settled’ to be correct. Savigny
connects it with stips, and uses Festus' interpretation of the word
(stipem esse nummum signatum, testimonium esse et id, quod datur
stipendium militi, et curn spondetur pecunia, quod stipulari dicitur) to
support his theory that stipulation in origin rested on the fiction of a
money loan. On the other hand, Isidorus says (Orig. 4. 24) ‘dicta
stipulatio a stipula: veteres enirn, quando sibi aliquid promittebant,
stipulam tenentes frangebant, quam iterum iungentes, sponsiones suas
agnoscebant!
