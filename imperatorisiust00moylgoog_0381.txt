paterni quam¹ materni, item filius filia, nepos neptis tam ex

filio quam ex iilia, frater soror sive consanguinei sive uterini)r ’

(5) Tum quam ex familia : the patron or patroness's nearest collateral
agnates. ‚

(6) Patronus, patrona, liberi et parentes eorum: i. e. the patron's or
patroness’s orm patron or patroness, and his or her cognatas in the direct
line.

(7) Vir et uxor: the surviving consort os the deceased, who by the civil
law had no right of succession whatever.

(8) The collateral cognates oi the patron within the sixth degree, Tit.
5. 5 supr. ln the extremely improbable event oi there being no one
belonging to even the lowest ol these classes to take bonorum possessio,
the estate escheated to the aerarium (later to the fiscus): ‘si nemo sit,
ad quem bonorum possessio pertinere possit, aut sit quidem, sed ius
suum omiserit, populo bona deferuntur ex lege Iulia caducaria,' Ulpian,
reg. 28. 7.

lt will be observed that, besides class 3, which related to wbat cannot
ever have been a very common case, classes 5, 6, and 8 did not come
into consideration unless the intestata were a lreedman or a freedwoman.
Class 3 became meaningless under Justinian’s new system ol emancipa-
tion, and the other three he altogether abolished. Thus in his legislation
intestate bonorum possessores were arranged in four classes only, their
order being-liberi, legitimi, cognati, vir et uxor; but he also retained an
anomalous group (§8 inl), called sometimes for the sake ol brevity ‘tum
quibus ex legibus,’ comprising those persons to whom the statute law
had enacted that bonorum possessio (as distinct from the hereditas)
should be given: e. g. the patron in concurrence with the children oi a
libertus under the lex Papia Poppaea, Tit. 7. 1 and 2 supr: ‘quippe cum
non alias huic competit bonorum possessio, quam silex specialiter delerat
bonorum possessionem’ Dig. 38. 14. 1. 2.

Fora discussion ol the probable origin oi bonorum possessio, and oi
its development into an organized scheme of succession, see Excursus lV,
at the end oi tbis Boolc A little more is necessary in order to thoroughly
understand its nature.

In order to obtain possession os property belonging to the deceased,
the bonorum possessor had, as such, a special procedure, the interdict
Quorum bonorum (Dig. 43. 2. 1.—pr., Gaius iv. 144), which had certain
advantages over the remedy available to the heres, quoheres (viz. here-
ditatis petitio, by which he established his title to the universitas iuris).
Thus, the interdict was never excluded by usucapio lucrativa (p. 221
supa: cf. Gaius ii. 52-58), and availed also against persons ‘qui dolo
desierant possidere :’ hereditatis petitio was not thus privileged until the
time os Hadrian, Dig. 5. 3. 20. 6-21, ib. 25. pr.-r7. lt is then no matter
lor surprise that heirs, who had an unimpeachable civil title, applied lor
bonorum possessio secundum tabulas in order to be ableto use the
interdict, d 1 supr, Gaius iii. 345 and similarly, as the heir could claim to
become bonorum possessor, so the praetor treated the bonorum possessor
