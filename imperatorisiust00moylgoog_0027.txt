12 INTRODUCTION.

this anomaly had originally been grounded on politieal considerationS,
it was now retained sor purposes of mere annoyance only; but the
deliverance of the plebeians was not yet. Even now too they were
still legally incapable of possessing the ager publicus ; and this ap-
peared the more hard, because, on the one hand, their taxation was
out of all proportion to that oi the patricians, while the possession
os the ager publicus was untaxed, and yet, on the other, it was
mainly through their own valour that it had become ager publicus
at all. Some slight compensation was made lor this by alex Cassia
(ac. 486) which effected a distribution of newly-conquered territory,
and placed some restrictions on the patrician enjoyment of the public
land. A third grievance was the unlimited power ol the magistrates
to inflict pecuniary fines ς’ this was curtailed hythe leges Menenia,
Tarpeia, and Papiria, passed between 460 and 430 nc. Lastly, the
patriciana controlled the entire administration ol justice ; it was the
consul who presided over the preliminary stage ol every aetion, and
it he did not decide it out of hand, the judges were most usually
the patrician decemviri, upon whom this function had been cast by
Servius Tullius, it was the pontifices themselves, members ol the
patrician caste, who interpreted the law, and solved its knotty prob-
lems. Moreover, the very enforcement ol the law depended on the
observance ol minute forms and technicalities of which, by reason
ol their implication with the ius sacrum, the plebeian could know
little or nothing. Some slight amelioration ol these hard conditione
must have been adorded by the lex Pinaria ¹, which belongs to this
period, and which, in certain classes ol actions (we may suppose, in
particular, actions ol debt), allowed the parties to choose a single
judge, to the exclusion ol the magistrates' own jurisdiction and ol the
decemviral court (Gaius iv. 15). But the class from which the judge
was to be chosen seems to have been limited iu some way ot' which
we have no certain knowledge; and the chief interest ol the lex
Pinaria is that it served as a precedent lor the principle enunciated
by Cicero (pro Cluentio 43) in the words ‘neminem voluerunt
maiores nostri esse iudicem nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset?

In the year a. c. 462 the tribune Terentillus had procured a reso-
lution ol the plebs, ‘ ut quinque viri creentur legibus de imperio con-
sulari scribendis,' which the senate refused to send on to the comitia
centuriata. Nothing daunted, he proposed, in the next year and in
the same way,a codification of the whole law by decemviri. This

¹ Its date was, according to Huschke, Β. e. 472 (Verlassung des Servius p. 595).
