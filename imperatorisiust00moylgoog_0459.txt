ξ Β. Cf. Bk. i. 20 supr. and note. The duties which the pupillus could
eniorce against the guardian by actio tutelae directa were, in general,
those os maintaining the full value of his property, and to a certain
extent even oi increasing it. The guardian was bound to keep it in
good order and condition, Cod 5. 37. 22, 3 and 4, and to seli such parts
of it as were liabie to spoli, Dig. ι36. 7. 7. 23 to call in all doubtful debts‚
Dig. ib. 15; if the property consisted mainly os money, to lay it out on
land, ib. 3. 2, or at interest, ib. 7. 3 ; and il he used any ol it sor his own
purposes‚ the rate of interest which he had to pay was the highest allowed
by law, ib. 7. 10 and 123 to duly conduct all necessary suits on the
ward's behalf, ib. 1, 3 and 4, and in the discharge of all these duties to
exercise that degree os care which he showed in his own affairs, i. e. he
was answerable ior culpa levis in concreto, Dig. 27. r. 3. pr. This would
be os importance where the ward was instituted heir, or lest a legacy or
fideicommissum, Cod. 5. 37. 21, Dig. 26. 7. 39 3.

ξ 3. This is called by the commentators communio incidens: ci. Dig.
17. 2. 21 ‘cum non affectione societatis incidimus in communionem.¹
The rights and duties of the colegatees, codonees, etc, inter se resemble
those os socii, sor which see on Tit. 35. 9 supr.

§4- Each of two or more coheredes, if they could not make a satis·
iactory partition by agreement, could compel a judicial division oi the
hereditas by the actio familiae erciscundae, in which the iudex also
adjusted 311 claims which each had acquired against the rest while their
coheir, (eg. bypaying debts‚ management, etc), during which time their
rights and duties inter se are substantially the same as those oi socii.
