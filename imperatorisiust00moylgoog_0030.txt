RELATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LA W. 15

years they remained the only complete legislation which professed to
embrace the whole positive law ol Rome, and though in point of
lact the greater part oi their original substance was repealed or
modiiied by subsequent enactments, the Roman citizen, even under
the Empire, always continued to revere them as the solid basis os the
noble system oi jurisprudence by which all his rights and duties were
determined3 and-it was only by the great work oi Justinian that,
nine hundred and eighty-four years after their enactrnent, they were
iormally deprived oi their authority.

At this point it will be well to pause in order to look back over the
centuries behind us and try to ascertain what was the material con·
tent and what the.scope oi the customary law which, as we have
seen, was to the early Romans the only rule oi lise, and which was
summed up and (ii we may use the expression) codiiied in the
Twelve Tables. Ausonius (ldyll xi. 61) describes the contents oi
the latter as ‘ius triplex:'

‘Sacrum privatum, populi commune quod usquam est?

But there is little to be said on this particular point except what can
be inserred from the fragments which have been preserved to us.
These relate to the procedure in an action, especially summons

(Table i), execution (iii), mancipation (vi) and emancipation (iv),
succession (v), curatela ol furiosi (vi), furtum, iniuria, and other
forms of delict (viii), and finally burial oi the dead (x). As might
perhaps bave been expected, the only really important department ol
the private code upon which, so sar as we know, the Twelve Tables
contained no provisions, is contract.

Legal antiquaries on the continent who have accepted as snb·
stantially true the myth which ascribes the origin ol Rome to the
uuion ol three tribes belonging to different ethnic stocltS, two oi
which are by them identified as Pelasgic and Sabine ¹, have spent
much ingenuity in attempting to detect the original diversity oi the
clemente contributed to the common stoclr oi jurisprudence by the
two dominant tribes, and to trace the gradual process by which these
were blended into a homogeneous system of law. They speak ol
the clement peculiar to tbe Ramnes, as opposed to that peculiar to
the Quirites; the genius oi the former people lay in the direction of
conquest and activity in external relations, that of the latter in the
promotion of domestic order and peacelul internal development ; and
