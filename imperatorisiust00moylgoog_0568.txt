minuitur: nam ob impensas in res dotales factas marito re·
tentio concessa est, quia ipso iure necessariis sumptibus dos
minuitur, sicut ex latioribus digestorum libris cognoscere liceat.

Sed et si quiscum parente suo patronove agat, item si socius 38

quam adversarius eius iacere potest. idem est, si quis ex

defendant was said to have a beneficium competentiae, which was
pleaded in desence as an exceptio, the creditor being bound to spate him
enough os his property to live on, except in actions based on delict and
fraud: ‘in condemnatione personarum, quaein id quod facere possunt
damnantur, non totum quod habent extorquendum est, sed et ipsorum
ratio habenda est, ne egeant’ Dig. 50. 17. 173 ; cs. Dig. 42. 1.19. 1.
This privilege was accorded by the law on three grounds. On account
ol the peculiar personal relation between tbe parties it belonged to
husband and wife against one another, to parents against children,
patrons against freedmen (ξ 38 int), and to the father-inlaw ir sued by the
husband sor a promised dos durante matrimonio. By reason ol the
nature os the obligation upon which the action was based it was possessed
by the husband and his representatives when sued sor the recovery ot a
dos, by socii inter se, and by the promisor os a gift (ξ 38 int). On account
of the personal position ol the debtor it belonged to the insolvent who
had made a cessio bonorum (ξ 4ο int), to soldiers against all creditors
whatsoever, and to children who had been recently released from patria
potestas in respect ol debts contracted while alieni iuris, unless by the
fathers death they had come into substantial property. F inally, the
beneficium might be acquired by contract, Dig. 2. 14. 49.

When sued ior the recovery ol the dos at the termination oi the
marriage by the wite, her heirs, or the paternal ascendant who had given
it, or during the marriage on account os mismanagement or insolvency,
the husband or his heirs or representatives could deduct impensae
necessariae, by the sum of which the vmueol the dos was held to have
tacitly (ipso iure) diminished. For impensae utiles as distinct irom
necessariae the husband could advance a claim only by actio mandati or
negotiorum gestorum, Cod, 5. 13. 5. The old retentiones propter liberos,
propter mores, etc, described by Ulpian, reg. 6. 9-17, wore obsoleto in
the time ot Justinian.

t 88. n the societas was omnium bonorum, the partner against whom
the actio pro socio was brought could plead beneficium competentiae as a
matter ol right ; il unius rei, the praetor would grant it only after investi·
gation: ‘quod autem de sociis dictum est, ut et hi in quantum facere
possint condemnentur, causa cognita se facturum praetor edicit ’ Dig. 42.
