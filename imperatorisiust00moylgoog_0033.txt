18 INTRODUCTJON.

mancipi, we know that lor many centuries a slave could not be
effectually enfranchised except by a public act ; that the earliest forms
ol wills were dispositione sanctioned either by direct legislative au-
thority ol the populus or by its representatives, the seven wimesses
ol the mancipation; and that the earliest mode in which a binding
contract could be concluded was possibly the socalled nerum, which
in all essential features was identical with mancipation. Thus the
authority oi the populus-the sanction of public law-was required
to validate almost every dealing between man and man, whether it
was a marriage, a sale, a contract, the manumission ol a slave, the
emancipation of a son, ora testamentary disposition

The prominent induence of tbe plebeian element os the state in the
development ol private law has been already alluded toas a laet
which by itsell appears beyond question. The theory now under
discussion has the merit ol explaining this fastand os carrying the
history ol the evolution ol private law even further baekwards. Suits
in which religious considerations or a religione sanction were involved
were submitted lor decision to the pontifices, presided over by the
king as pontifex maximus; and it is represented that religion occu-
pied so large a sphere in the lile oi early Rome that the whole ol the
original law may be regarded as partly ius publicum, partly ius
sacrum. What was subsequently known as ‘ius privatum' attained
agradual recognition and advanced by timid steps to independence
under the protecting aegis ol ius sacrum: ‘ius sacrum was the form
which private law at first assumed, and in which it first received an
independent though subordinate existence, as against the absorbing
and preponderating weight ol ius publicum! But the plebs, when it
became an integral partos the Roman state, was free from all pre·
iudices based on the history of the populus; and ‘it was in the plebs
that the ius Quiritium, the private portion ol the code, received its lull
development, and lrom the plebs that Rome got an idea which
perhaps otherwise she would never have got-the idea oia private
person' The relations ol a private person must be govemed by
private law, and thus it is to the plebeian clement in the state that the ,
main institutione ol private law are to be ascribed. Some of these
developments—the new forms ol marriage and os adoption-have
been already suggested But the plebs consisted ol persons who
were no partos the populus; exactly then as the members os the
latter (who bad now come to be called patricians) could only possess
aud enjoy land, but not own it, so the members ol the former,
precisely because they were uot of the populus, could only, il they
