Omne autem ius, quo utimur, vel ad personas pertinet vel 12
adres vel ad actiones ac prius de personis videamus narn
parurn est ius nosse, si personae, quarum causa statutum est,

Constantine, and he decides it in the passage cited from the Code: a
custom can certainly abrogare a statute, but (he says) there is an excep·
tion to this general rule, is tbe statute itsell contains a provision that no
custom is to be allowed to grow up in future contrary to its tenor ; a pro-
vision addressed to the subject, and forbidding the custom itself, not to
the sovereign, and forbidding the repeal οἱ the statute.

For the perrnanence and immutability of natural law cf. Cicero de
Republ. iii. 22, Dig. 7. ς. 2. 1 ς 50. 17. 8. By such passages it is not
meant that it is always binding on the citizen, but that what is ‘natural'
once is natural lor ever ; ior, as Ulpian says, ‘ius civile [iuri naturali] non
per omnia servit’ Dig. 1. r. 6. pr. Similarly Gaius, speaking of the quasi
usufruct mentioned in Bk. ii. 4. 2 ini, remarks that though the authority
of the senate cannot overcome naturalis ratio, its commands are binding;
Dig. 7. 5. 2. r.

tion to this Book.

§L Liberty does not require that one should be free to act against
the laws, ‘legum quum servi sumus, ut liberi esse possimus’ Cicero pro
Cluentio 53. 146. Cf. Persius, Sat. v. 89 ‘Liceat, iussit quodcunque vo-
luntas, Excepto si quid Masuri [ie. Sabinus’ work on law] rubrica vetavit,'
Dio Chrysostom, or. 14 ὅσα μὴ ἀπείρηται ὑπὸ τῶν νόμων, μηδὲ προστέτακται,
ὄπερῖ τούτων ἔχων τὴν ἐξουσίαν τοῦ πράττειν tiis βούλεται . . . ἐλεύθερος.

52. ln respect of capacity os right, slavery is a condition ol absolute
‘rightlessness’ A slave could have no rights against either his master
orany one else; and, remembering what has been said of the legal mean·
ing ol ‘person’ in the Introduction to this Book, it follows that a slave
was not a ‘person’ at all: he had no caput, Tit. 16. 4 inf. The Roman
lawyers looked upon him as a ‘res,’ and applied to him, as an object
ol property, the same rules which they laid down as to domestic animab,
sofar as there is any difference oi treatment it is due to the slave's pos-
session of reason, so that (a) he is able to increase his master’s means by
his intellectual as well as by his physical powers, and (b) by manumission
