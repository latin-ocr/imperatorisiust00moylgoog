Aliquando autem evenit, ut liberi, qui statim ut nati sunt 13
in potestate parentum non fiant, postea tamen redigantur in
potestatem. qualis estis, qui, dum naturalis suerat, postea
curiae datus potestati patris subicitur. nec non is, qui a
muliere libera procreatus, cuius matrimonium minime legibus
interdictum luerat, sed ad quam pater consuetudinem habuerat,

postea ex nostra constitutione dotalibus instrumentis com-
positis in potestate patris efficitur: quod et aliis, si ex eodem
matrimonio suerint procreati, similiter nostra constitutio
praebuit.

legal significance. ln many respects it was assimilated to marriage:
thus Ulpian says (Dig. 32. 49. 4) ‘parvi autem refert, uxori an concu-
binae quis leget, quae eius causa emta parata sunt: sane enim, nisi
dignitate, nihil interest' But the position was thought a degrading one
to the woman ; no honesta semina could become a concubine without an
express ‘testatio,’ Dig.25.7.1.1; otherwise the relation was regarded
as stuprum. A man could have but one concubine at a time, and con-
cubinatus was incompatihle with marriage ι ‘eo tempore quo quis uxorem
habet, concubinam habere non potest: concubina igitur ab uxore solo
dilectu separatur’ Paul. sent. rec. 2. 20. The connection was terminated
hy insanity ol either party, except between patronus and liberta. The
paternity ol the children was recognised to a considerable extent: they
were capable of legitimation, section 13 ini, entitied to maintenance, and
even possessed rights ol succession on the fathers intestacy. By the
later emperors concubinatus was discouraged. Constantine denied chil-
dren who were born ol it any benefit under their iather's will, and pro-
hibited it altogether among high imperial officials ς hut it was not made
generally unlawlul until the ninth century, by Leo Philosophus. lf a dos
were given in a marriage which violated the rules as to prohibited degrees,
it escheated, when the marriage terminated, to the Treasury, Dig. 23.

ὁ 13. ln the time ol Gaius childrenwho were not in potestas at birth,
owing to the nuptiae not being iustae, could sometimes be afterwards
subjected to it by causae probatio, by which Latins and peregrini, with
their consorts, obtained the civitas: their matrimonium thereby became
legitimum, and even the children already bom were subjected, by a
process analogous to that of postliminium, to the resulting potestas.
Among such causae were the birth of a child to a Latin father (Gaius
ἰ 66), and justifiahle mistake (ib. 67); see generally, Gaius i. 29-32, 66-75.

In Justinian's time, natural children could be subjected to potestas by
legitimation‚ and this in three ways, two ol which are mentioned in the
text: (1) by oblatio curiae: i. e. the father made the son a decurio, or
married the daughter to a decurio, in a provincial town. The decuriones
formed a kind of town council, or body, which had to bear the burden
ol the magistracies (honores) and other municipal ‘expenses (munera);
