· THE snrcr. 31

which the praetor Atilius (sc. ²13) directed against the encmachments
of strange religions, though a ‘law,' was yet an edictum repentinum.
lt also became usual for each successive praetor to adopt, in sub
stance, the edict os his predecessor, with such additions, abrogations,
and changes as he deemed expedient. Such part of his edict as a
praetor derived from that olbis predecessor in office was called
edictum tralaticium. It was owing to this fact that, though the edict
of each individual praetor had such an ephemeral validity, the prae·
torian law was at once so stable aud yet so clastic. By the constant
accretion of new rules which legal development and increasing corn·
mercial activity required, the edict assumed the form osa permanent
body of law, which had the advantage ol the ius civile in the ease
with which it cordd be repealed‚ altered, or extended, and which,
therefore, apart from other considerations‚ recommended itself asa
mode of legislation in many ways preferable to that of the comitia.
The danger of entrusting to the caprice of a single individuel so
large a power of altering the law will strilre every reader3 but it had
two very efficient saleguards. One of these' was a strong public and
professional opinion: the other was the short duration of the praetor's
office. If one praetor ventured on innovations which were not
approved by the people or the lawyer class, his successor could easily
removebis obnoxious additions from the edict, for a year they would
be binding, but beyond that they had not necessarily any validity.
ln point of fact, it would seem that each praetor framed his edict
after mreful consultation with his friends learned in the law, and that

changes were but rarely introduced for which public opinion was not -

ready; the fact, already noticed, that each praetor always accepted a
very large portion of the edict of his predecessor, a portion, indeed,
which every year grew comparatively larger, as every year made the
edict more complete, proves that the Roman praetors, as a class,
were the best of conservatives. Cicero accuses Verres of having
'ssued ‘edicta nova in re vetere‚' and altered rules for which the con-
stant acceptance of his predecessore had won the confidence and
affection of the people; but we ma'y believe that Verres had lew
imitatore, and that, as a general rufe, both parts of the edictum per-
petuum—the part which was old and the part which was new-were
alike vieved with approval by the mass of the people. Though,
however, few were guilty ol Verres’ breach of faith, who, according
to Cicero (in Verr. i. 46), in his judicial administration sometimes
followed a course the very opposite of that which in his edict he had

deliberately stated be intended to take, it seems that in the last cen·
