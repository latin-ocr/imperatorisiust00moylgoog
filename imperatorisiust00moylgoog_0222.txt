aaa] DE SERVIT UT IBUS. 207

tollat quis aedes suas, ne luminibus vicini officiatur. In rusti-2
corum praediorum servitutes quidam computari recte puta‘
aquae haustum, pecoris ad aquam adpulsum, ius pascendi,
calcis coquendae, harenae fodiendae.

Ideo autem hae servitutes praediorum appellantur, quoniam 3
sine praediis constitui non possunt. nemo enim potest ser-
vitutem adquirere urbani vel rustici praedii, nisi qui habet
praedium, nec quisquam debere, nisi qui habet praedium. Si4
quis velit vicino aliquod ius constituere, pactionibus atque

non avertendi, which seem to operate only in the way ol sreeinga
building from some pre-existiag obligation. hlr. Poste (Gaius p. 179)

explains this by supposing that an urban, servitude can be extinguished
only by the acquisition ol a contrary servitude by the praedium serviens.
But perhaps it is better to suppose that these anomalouseervitudes
occurred only where the laws limited the rights ol owners by forbidding
them to build above a certain height, compelling thern to receive their
neighbours' rainwater, etc. A law ol Zeno ol this nature, enacted origin-
ally for Constantinople only, was extended to all the cities ol the empire
by Justinian (Cod. 8. 10. 12 and r 3). Is this is so, it is difficult to con-
ceive the right in question as a servitude at all.¹
§ 2. The n'ghts mentioned in this section are treated as rustic
’ servitudes by Neratius (Dig. 8. 3. 2 sq), and by Papinian, Paulus, and
Ulpian. The word ‘recte' seems to imply that by some they were not
so considered, though there is no trace in the authorities ol a difference
ol opinion. Ι
§ 4. The old mode os constituting servitudes between the parties had
been in iure cessio, Gaius ii. 29. 30, rustic servitudes in Italy also ad·
mitting of creation by mancipatio. These processes, however, could be
employed only inrespect ol' objects which could themselves be trans-
ferred in the same manner, so that (Gaius ii. 31) servitudes over praedia
provincialia, which were not ‘in patrimonio,’ could not thus be created.
ln delault, the occupiers of land in the provinces resorted to bare agree·
ments (pactio), subsequently expressed in a formal and solemn contract
(stipulatio), by which the owner of the land which was to be subjected
to the servitude bound himself to allow its enjoyment, or in delault to
pay apenal sum, e. g. ‘per te non fieri neque per heredem tuum, quo·
minus mihi heredique meo ire agere liceat; si adversus ea lactum sit,
tantum dari' Dig.45. 1. 2. 5. Α 'right thus created could not in itsell
avail in rem, or ‘run with the land ;’ yet it seems clear from Gaius (ii.
31) that in his time such pactiones and stipulationes were as eflectual to
create servitudes over provincial soil as in iure cessio and mancipatio
over praedia Italica We must consequently suppose that the praetor had
intervened, and by the introduction os an utilis actio (consessoria) lor the
protection ol the promise against all successore ol the other in title had
given the right a genuine ‘real’ character. ln Justinian’s time ol course
