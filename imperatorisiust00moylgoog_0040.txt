F UNCT IONS OF COMITIA AND SENA T E-COLONIES. 25

01 the two comitia which we have just been considering, the
comitia tributa, as might have been inferred from its history, con-
cerned itseli mainly with ordinary domestic legislation‚ the great Ι
maiority 01 enactments which relate to private law being plebiscita;
the leading business 01 the comitia centuriata was the electiou 01
magistrates and deliberation on high political matters. Alter the
latter assembly had acquired its full powers, the oldest gathering 01
all, the comitia curiata, dropped back into a position oi quite secon-
dary importante, and its right 01 independent legislation was less and
less frequently exercised. The iunctione which it continued to dis·
charge ‘were the approwal 01 such resolutioris 01 the centuries as by
inveterate custom required a religious sanction, and 01 other legal
dispositions which were deerned incomplete unless confirmed in this
manner. The action 01 the curiae is in fact implicated with that 01
the pontifices, to whom was first submitted any business ior which it
was desired to obtain the legislative sanction oi this comitia; ior
instance, the form 01 adoption known as adrogation‚ and the lex
curiata de imperio, by which the higher magistrates, with the ex·
ception 01 the censors, were invested with their authority, both have a
religious significance. It is not known how long the patricians con·
tinued to attend the meetings in person ; iar before Cicero’s time
they were merely represented by thirty lictors.

The senate apparently did not exercise any purely legislative
authority till the last century sa. Besides its important sanction 01
discussing all matters before they were submitted to the assembly
oi the centuries, which indeed could not be so submitted at all without
a senatorial resolution ‘ut de ea read populum ferretur,' it exercised a
considerable iniluence in this period over the elections. Originally
it nominated the candidates whose names the consul was to lay beiore
the comitia3 when the plebeians became eligible to all the higher
magistracies, this right iell into desuetude‚ and free canvassing be·
came the rule. But the senate was still able to make its weight felt
through the magistrate who conducted the elections ; and by the ne-
cessity 01 its ‘auctoritas’ it controlled the comitia curiata, whose
approval 01 the choice made by the centuries was given, as has just
been observed, hythe lex curiata de imperio. Even 01 this influenee
the senate was indirectly deprived by a lex Maenia, by which it
was enacted that the senatorial auctoritas to the comitia curiata
should be given before instead 01 aiter the assembly 01 the centuries
in which the magistrates were elected.
