represented in a money value was clearly no obligation at all. There
are writers, however, who deny the application of this principle under
Justinian, on the ground that its original reason had disappeared

along with the introductiou of specific performance: others dis-
tinguish between obligations stricti iuris and bonae fidei (Blc iv. 6.
28 ini), holding that in the latter regard was paid to the feelings no
less than to the purse of the creditor, while in the former the putee
alone was considered.

(3) The object of the obligation must be possible of performance
both in nature and by law (see Blr. iii. 19. 1 and notes), e. g. no duty
would arise froma promise to convey a res extra commercium but
one can be validly bound to perform an act at present impossible in
the event of its becoming possible (Dig. 45. r. 98. pr) ; further, it must
not be unlawful, Dig. 45. r. 26, ib. ay. pr.

(4) The actor forbearance must be sufficiently definite, or at least
capable of being rendered so ; e.g. one cannot be bound to do just
so much as and no more than one pleases, Dig. 45. 1. 108. r.

The classification of obligations according to the mode in which
they on'ginate meets us in Blr. iii. 13. a, and is spoken of in the
notes to that passage; another division, of great prominence in
Roman law, requires some explanation. An obligation is none the
less an obligation merely because the creditor is unable to enforcc it
by action3 there are other modes in which the duty may be dis·
charged besides this, so that the relation faiis only in one of its most
ordinary incidents. Actionability is only one of such usual incidents,
though perhaps the most characteristic of all, and an obligatio does
not lose its legal character by reason of its absence only. Such
non-actionable obligations are said to be ‘naturah’ in contrast with
those which are ‘civil,’ ie. enforceable by action; in Dig. 46. 3.
95. 4, the bond is called vinculum aequitatis, as being imposed by
equity‚ though the precise relation of the ‘nature' implied ina
natural obligation, and the nature whose law is identified by the
jurists with equity and the iungentium, is somewhat obscure. That
the jural recognition of such obligations originated in the ius gentium
seems to be affirmed in Dig. 50. 17.84. r ‘is natura debet, quern
iure gentium dare oportet, cuius fidem secuti sumus: though by some
writers it is ascribed to natural law in a philosophica] rather tharra
legal sense

Some obligations are natural ab initio ; in other words, an act or
event produces a natural obligation, which under other circumstances
would have been civil: there isareason why in the particular case
