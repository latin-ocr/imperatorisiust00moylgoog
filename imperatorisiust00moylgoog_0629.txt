rape oi the Sabine women, andis expressly stated by Festus, who
ascribes the custom to Romulus' success in thus providing himseli
with a wile. Even the gods were supposed to get their earthly minis
ters in much the same unceremonious manner ; the vestal virgin, says
Gellius (i. rs. ξ 13)‘pontificis maximi muru prehensa ab eo parente
in cuius potestate est veluti bello capto abducitur.’ The spear was the
oldest symbol of right ; hence there was no stronger title than pur·
chase ‘sub basta' at a sale held by state authority; it was planted iu
the ground in the centumviral court, which had a special jurisdiction
in questions ol ownership: it appeared in the vindicatio or real action,
and its use in manumission per vindictam will occur to every reader.
Property in land was never called anytbing by the Romans but prae-
dium ; the analogy with praeda, ‘booty,' suggests itseli at onoc, and
has been noticed by early writers one oi whom remarks ‘antiqui
agros quos bello ceperant ut praedae nomine habebant’ Again, the
term manus, meaning primarily ‘hand' and derivatively ‘power,' ‘force'
‘control' plays an extremely prominent partin early legal phraseology.
Perhaps its frequency in procedure (eg. manum conserere, manus
iniectio) is due to the survival ln judicial institutions oi traces ol an
older system, namely, violent seli-redress oi wrong ;. but Sir H. hlaine
has observed (Ancient Law p. 317) that there is very strong reason
ior believing that manus was the ancient geneml term expressing
power, whether exercised over· ilocks, herds, slaves, children, or wile:
and there is an affinity between herus, ‘owner,' and the Greek χείρ,
through the Sanskrit br, which has the same meaning as the latin
root cap. On the other hand, while to denote man the Sanskrit and
Greek agree (nri, nara, ἀνὴρ), the Romans have discarded the corre·
sponding word, and use ‘vin' which in Sanskrit mearns ‘warriors’ they
name him not from his sex, but srom his calling and occupatiori:
‘virtue' is conceived first and ioremost ss valour in war, only lateras
purity and honesty. The very name in which the Romans delighted,
and which their satirists cast in their teeth--Quirites—may be taken
as a final illustration: Quiris or Curis in old Sabine is equivalent to
hasta; Quirites are ‘spearmen :’ and thus we see how dominium ex
iure Quiritium has a deeper meaning, as carrying us back to the
prehistoric time when the strong man armed could alone possess his
goods in peace.

ln. such a social condition the only mode in which a man who
conceived himself wronged by another could obtain satisfaction was
by taking the law, as itis said, into his own hands. A system ol
seli-redress, in the form ol private vengeance, preceded everywhere
