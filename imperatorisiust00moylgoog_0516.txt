Tit. 1.] DE OBLIGATIONIBUS QUAE, ET C. 501

ab aliquo tibi oblata sit eaque apud te concepta sit, utique si
ea mente tibi data fuerit, ut apud te potius quam apud eum
qui dederit conciperetur: nam tibi, apud quem concepta sit,
propria adversus eum qui optulit, quamvis fur non sit, con·
stituta est actio, quae appellatur oblati. est etiam prohibiti
furti actio adversus eum, qui furtum quaerere testibus prae·
sentibus volentem prohibuerit. praeterea poena constituitur
edicto praetoris per actionem furti non exhibiti adversus eum,
qui furtivam rem apud se quaesitam et inventam non exhibuit.
sed hae actiones, id est concepti et oblati et furti prohibiti
necnon furti non exhibiti, in desuetudinem abierunt. curn

enim requisitio rei furtivae hpdie secundum veterem obser·
vationem non fit: merito ex consequentia etiam praefatae
actiones ab usu communi recesserunt, cum manifestissimum
est, quod omnes, qui scientes rem furtivam susceperint et
celaverint, furti nec manifesti obn'oxii sunt. Poena manifestio
furti quadrupli est tam ex servi persona quam ex liberi, nec
manifesti dupli.

Twelve Tables at three times the value of the property stolen, Gaius iii.
191. The offence of furtum prohibitum, for which the praetor established
a penalty of four times the value (Gaius iii. 192) was not recognised by
the decemviral legislatori, apparently, it has been suggested, because the
house was according to the primitive view not only an asylum, but under
the special protection of the household gods—Vesta and the Penates-
who dwelt and were worshipped there. But the Twelve Tables provided
that if, after search was resisted‚ actual search was made with peculiar
formalities, and the stolen property was discovered, the furtum should be
treated as manifestum, Gaius iii. 192-4 This was called furtum lance et
licio conceptum, and must have become obsolete when the praetor had
imposed the same penalty for mere resistance to search. When
Justinian says that search for stolen property was in his day no longer
conducted secundum veterem observationem he means, in the presence
of witnesses (τούτεστι μαρτύρων παρόντων Theoph.) ς it was undertaken by
public officets, Dig. 4. ι.“3, apractice which seems to have been in use in
the time of Plautus : ‘ad praetorem ibo, ut conquisitores mihi det’ Mercat.
3. 4. 78. Furtum conceptum and oblatum had been coordinated with
manifestum and nec manifestum by Servius Sulpicius and Sabinus as
distinct species of theft; Gaius agreed with Labeo that they were
‘species potius actionis furto cohaerentes quam genera furtorum' iii. 183.
The offence of furtum non exhibitum is not mentioned except in this
passage of the institutes.
