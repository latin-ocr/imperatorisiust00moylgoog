first deducting from it debts owed to himself in full. There is also a
discussion of the relative advantages to the creditor of these different
actions and of a condictio, where he has an option ; and in § 7 we
have a notice of the SC. Macedonianum, which refused an action
upon money loans given to a child in power against the latter himself
no less than against the paterfamilias.

In the following Title (8) there is a corresponding treatment of the
dominus' and paterfamilias’ liability on the delicts of those in their
potestas. The law by which the several delicts had been constituted,
whether civil or praetorian, had given the superior the option of pay·
ing damages or surrendering the delinquent, as a slave or in mancipio,
to the injured person. Justinian definitely confirmed as law the usage
which had grovm up under the later Empire, and which limited this
‘noxal' surrender to slaves: children in power were to be personally
liable on their delicts, and the paterfamilias free. The maxim ‘norr-
alis actio caput sequitur’ is explained in ξ 5, and in ξ 6 there is a
discussion of the effecta of delicts committed by slaves against their
own masters. The application of noxal surrender in the case of
pauperies, or damage done by certain domesticated animala, is treated
in Title 9, which also gives some account of a penal action introduced
by the aedile for the redress of injuries or damage done by wild
animals kept under insufficient control near places of public resort.

The Titles between the 9th and the 15th have a nearer relation '
to Procedure proper than the other parts of this Boolr, and are all
closely modelled after Gaius. The first of them deals, though some.
what uninstructively‚ with the employment of agents or attomeys in
litigation, which, originally tolerated only in very few cases, had, as
Justinian remarks, become almost universally permissible under the
later practice. Title 11 gives a historical account of the earlier law
as to the security to be given by plaintilfs and defendente, especially
when represented by such attorneys, and then proceeds to state the
rules in force upon this subject under Justinian, and Title ra discusses
the active and passive transmission of rights of action, their extinction
bya longer or shorter prescription, and the right of a defendant under
the maxim ‘omnia iudicia absolutoria' to be acquitted it he satisfied
the plaintill's claim at any moment before judgment.

Exceptiones-a class of defences consisting in the plea of a counter·
vailing right as distinct from a direct denial of the plaintifi‘s allega-
tione-form the subject of Title 13, and are copiously illustrated in
its first few paragraphs. The most important classification of them,
