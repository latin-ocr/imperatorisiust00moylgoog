68 INTRODUCTION.

which the human will can operate. These are, in brief, one's own
person, and the external world ,· the latter again being divided into
reasonable and unreasonable, or persons 3ηά things

As regards one's own person, our attention is at once directed to
the so-called primordial rights, or rights of personal inviolability in
respect of freedom, reputation, 3ηά so forth. These, however, apart
and by themselves, Savigny does not consider a proper subject ol law.
He admits that 3 man ought to have the sole control ol his own
person 3ηά powers, but the right to such control does not fall within
the lren of the law except as the basis of rights and relations which
belong to other parts of the code—which, that is to say, ought not to
be regarded simply as developments of this personal inviolability, from
which their context is clearly distinguishable (System i. p. 336-7).
‘Aequired rights’ are thus the only proper subject of private law, and
these, as has been pointed out, can relate to either persons or things.

i. Over unreasonable portions of the external world, or things, a
person may exercise absolute control. Such absolute control is called
dominion or ownership, and the law relating to it is known as the law
of things (Sachenrecht). Ownersbip, however, is capable of many
forms and modificatione, the separation of its elements leads to the
conception of servitudes and other rights in re aliena; 3ηά again, its
actual exercise is distinguishable from the right, whence arises the law
relating to Possession. The main elements of the law of things will
thus be Ownersbip, iura in re aliena, and Possession.

ii. To the reasonable portion of the external world, or to other per·
sons, one may stand in either of two quite different relations. Firstly,
one man may be related to another somewhat in the way in which,
as we have seen, he may be related to things. Over a thing he may
exereise complete dominion, in which case it is absolutely subjected
to his will; overa person he cannot exereise this power, which im-
plies an entire negation of freedom and personality. But he may ex-
ercise a partial dominion, 3 dominion which consists with that other
person's freedom. inasmuch as it does not extend to all his actions,
but only to one or some of them. If one man is absolutely subjected
to the will of another, he is, jurally, not a person, but a thing ; but if
that other is, jurally, master of only certain of his actions, and jurally
entitled to compel him to this or that act or forbearance only, he is,
except in respect of this portion of his activlty, still free and 3 person.
We thus get the idea of obligation as distinct from dominion, 3ηά
these together form the two parts of what is called the law of property,
the relation between them being twofold: (a) if one person refuses to
