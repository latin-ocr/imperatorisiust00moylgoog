558 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [marr.

5 Ceterum dubium nou est, quinis quoque, qui iussu domini
contraxerit cuique institoria vel exercitoria actio competit,
de peculio deque eo, quod in rem domini versum est, agere
possit: sed erit stultissimus, si omissa actione, qua facillime
solidum ex contractu consequi possit, se ad difficultatem
perducat probandi in rem domini versum esse, vel habere
servum peculium et tanturn habere, ut solidum sibi solvi
possit. Is quoque, cui tributoria actio competit, aeque de
peculio et in rem verso agere potest: sed sane huic modo

on the strength ol peculium castrense or quasi-castrense, Dig. 49. 17. 18.
5. Here the creditor is enabled to sue the dominus by the actio de
peculio et in rem verso, in which two questions usually lie sor the judge’s
consideration; (1) has the master himself derived any material advantage
from the contract in question? No stress can herebe laid on the language

· ol the text above, which suggests that the dominus was liable only is the

expenditure of the slave upon his affairs was necessary (necessario...
rem necessariam) ; in Dig. τ 5. 3. 3. a and 45 ib. 5. pr. and a expenditure
which is utilis, and in 3. 401' the same Title an outlay which merely ⁴ ad
voluptatem domini spectat' is said to be recoverable by de in rern verso ;

and in lact this action lay wherever actio mandati or negotiorum
gestorum would lie: ‘et regulariter dicimus totiens de in rem verso esse t
actionem, quibus casibus procurator mandati, vel qui negotia gessit, nego· Ῑ

tiorum gestorum haberet actionem, quotiensque aliquid consumsit servus,
ut aut meliorem rem dominus habuerit, aut non deteriorem ' Dig. 15. 3. 3
a. Il in rem versio in this sense could be established, the masters own
means were liable pro tanto; and the advantage which he had derived
might have been so great that the creditor might conceivably obtain
full payment in this manner, as e. g. where the slave had borrowed 501,
and spent the whole ol it in paying his masters debts. But (2) is the

master has derived no material benefit from the slave's contract, or at ¹

least not enough to make him liable to the creditor in solidum, the judge
has to inquire into the amount oi the slave’s peculium (deducting the
master’s own claims against it), and to condemn the dominus to pay the
creditor [τοττι it what is due to him, sofar as it extends at the date os the
condemnation, Dig. r 5. 1. 30. pr. The master's liability to de peculio
lasted lor an annus utilis alter the slave was alienated or manumitted,
Dig. 15. 2. The reason why the dominus here enjoyed the privilege,
which he did not possess under the circumstances described in 5 3 supr,
ol paying his own claims against the slave from the peculium in lull, was
the lact that here the contract had in no way been sanctioned by him.
For vicarii servi see on Bk. ii. 20. 17 supr. ‘ 1d, quod ipsis (sc. vicariis)
debet ordinarius servus, non deducetur de peculio ordinarii servi, quia
peculium eorum in peculio ipsius est :¹ el. Theophilus, ἵνα μὴ τὸ αὐτὸ
πρόσωπιιν εὑρεθῇ δύο r’vdvrur ποιοῦν, rai αὔξον καὶ ἂπομειοῦν τὸ peculium.
