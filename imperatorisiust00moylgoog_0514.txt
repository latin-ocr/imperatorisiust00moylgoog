est, quod clam et obscure fit et plerumque nocte: vel a
fraude: vel a ferendo, id est auferendo: vel a Graeco sermone,

different species of theft (for of these there are but two, §3 inf), but to

· suggest the comprehensive character of the delict, and the chief forms
which the contrectatio might take. lts meaning in effect is this: the
general character of furtum consists in intentionally dealing witha res
mobilis in a wrongful manner, and usually the res is aliena, whether the
intention be to appropriate ownership in it (ipsius rei) or merely to use it
in au unauthorized manner (usus); but it is possible to commit thefi on
property of one's own, though to do this it is as a rule essential that the
property should be in the lawful possession of another person, the in·
teution being to dispossess the latter (possessionis). By Theophilus
furtum possessionis is understood to mean the wrongful appropriation of
a thing by a person who already has possession or detention of it (ὅτε τὸ
δοθὲν ἐπὶ τῷ νέμεσθαι ὥς ἐνέχυρον ἦ dtr δεπόσιτον νέμομαι ciis δεσπότης), in
other words, the arbitrary and wrongful conversion of detention or civil
possession into usucapion possession corpore et animo ; but this0is rather
furtum ipsius rei, and Theophilus' view is discountenanced by ἐξ 6-10
inf: cf. Dig. 47. 2. 74.

Furtum then may occur in any of the following ways :

(1) Theft in the popular sense: ‘cum quis rem alienam invito domino
contrectat’ ξ 6; ‘fur est, qui dolo malo rem alienam contrectat’ Paul. sent.
rec. 2. 31· 1.

(2) The wrongful appropriation ofa res aliena which one already
possesses or detains, eg. as depositary, agent, usufructuary, etc. (cf.
Theophilus supr.) ; of this no illustrations are given in this Title, but see
Dig. 47. 2. 1.2; ib. 333 ib. 43.1; 16. 3. 29; 17. naa. 7.

(3) Τὴε wrongful appropriation of property found, Bk. ii. 1. 48 supr,
Dnnzoeu

(4) The mala fide alienation of a res aliena, Bk. ii. 6. 3 supr. Ι

(5) The wilful destruction of bonds in order to destroy evidence of debt,
Dig. 47. 2. 283 ib. 323 iba 52.

(6) The wrongful using of a res aliena of which one has possession or
detention, e g by depositarius, pledgee‚ or commodatarius ,torni

(7) Furtum of res sua, ξ lo and notes, inf.

For the prohibitiones furtum by natural law cf. Cic. de off. 3. 5 ‘illud
natura non patitur, ut aliorum spoliis nostras facultates augeamus,
Augustin. confessa 4. 1 ‘furtum cene punit lex scripta in cordibus
hominum.³ Among certain peoples (eg. the Egyptians, Lacedaemoniam,
and Samians) theft rs said to have been allowed by their own municipal
lav, Diodor. Sic. 1. 80, Xenophon, rep. Laced. a. 8, Plutarch, Lycurgus
12.
