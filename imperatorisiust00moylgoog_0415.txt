400 INST 1 T UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [tib. 111.

stipulatori adquiratur, solvi tamen Seio etiam invito eo recte·

possit, ut liberatio ipso iure contingat, sed ille adversus Seium
habeat mandati actionem. quod si quis sibi et alii, cuius iuri
subiectus non sit, decem dari aureos stipulatus est, valebit
quidem stipulatio: sed utrum totum debetur quod in stipu-
latione deductum est, an vero pars dimidia, dubitatum est:
sed placet non plus quam partem dimidiam ei adquiri. ei
qui tuo iuri subiectus est si stipulatus sia, tibi adquiris, quia
vox tua tamquam tilii sit, sicuti filii vox tamquam tua in·

C’s filiusfamilias 01 slave) confers no rights on either B or C ς 1101 011 Β,
because he has no interest, the promise not being to do something for
him, ‘inventae sunt enim huiusmodi obligationes ad hoc ut unusquisque
sibi adquirat quod sua interest,’ § 19 inf. ; and not on C, because he is no
party to the contract. But

(1) B will acquire a right under the promise (a) if by the performance
to C he himself obtains a benedt, § 20 inf, and this is the reason why the
pater or dominus is entitled under a promise made to him of perfonnance
to his filiusfamilias or slave; the limits to the right are marked by the
passage cited from Dig. 45. 1. 131. on Tit. 17. 2 supr. : cf. Cod. 8. 39. 33
(b) if he has stipulated for a poena in default of perforrnance, ξ 19 inf.

(2) C will acquire a right under the promise not only, as is said here,
if heis the promisee’s dominus or pater, but also in a number of other
cases, of which the following are the most important : (a) if the promisee
is merely his messenger or intermediary (but not agent), and the contract
is real or consensual (i. e. not stipulation), Dig. 2. 14. 2. pr.: 13. 5. 14. 3 ς
(b) if the transaction is a mutuum given, oran indebitum paid, by B in
C’s name C can bring the condictio in person, Dig. 12. 1. a. 43 ib. 9. 8 ;
12. 6. 6. 47 ; (c) a pupil could sue by actio utilis on a constitutum made
by his guardian in his name, Dig. 27. 7. 9 pr., and plead the exceptio doli
if sued by his creditor with whom the guardian had made a pactum de
non petendo on his behalf, Dig. 2. 14. 15 ; lb. 28, 1 ; (d) where perform·
ance was promised to a man and his heir: ‘suae personae adiungere
quis heredis personam potest' Dig. 45. 1. 38. 14, though this isin reality
no exception to the general rule. But if A promised B to deso and so for
bis (B’s) heir (and not for himself) the promise was void, Gaius iii. 1583
this was altered by Justinian‚ Cod. 8. 38. 11 ; cf. ξ 13 inf. (e) lf a gilt
were made by Β to A on condition of its transfer to C, Cod. 8. 55. 3.
(7) If in settling a dos on a woman its restoration to her or her
descendants was stipulated for, Dig. 24 3. 45, Cod. 5. 14. 7. (g) 11
property was deposited with or lent to A by Β 011 condition of its being
given up to C, Cod. 3. 42. 8.

Sometimes, however, a person acquired rights under a contract in
which he was not directly a party, and was not even so much as named:
in particular (a) where the promisee was a slave or filiusfamilias: see on
