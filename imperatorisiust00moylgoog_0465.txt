the word ‘tollitur,' which apparently is not used when the creditor’s right
is merely deprived of its efficacy ope exceptionis. This treatment, how-
ever, is open to the criticism that, if it is intended to relate to the modes
in which all obligations may be dissolved, it is wrongly placed, its proper
position being between Tities 5 and 6 of Book iv., and also omits one
important mode in which some obligations ex delicto could be ex-
tinguished; while, if it purports to describe only the discharge of con·
tractual obligation, it is pro tanto inadequate, and even on that supposition
inexhaustive ; yet this seems to be what was in fact intended by Gaius,
whom Justinian here follows closely.

Τὴε effect of datio in solutum, the payment of aliud pro alio with the
creditors consent, was in Gaius’ time (iii. 168) matter of dispute The
Sabinians (whom Justinian follows) held that it operated ipso iure, the
Proculians‚ that it only gave rise to an exceptio doli if an action were
subsequently brought on the debt. The creditor must taire ‘aliud pro
alio’ nolens volens if it becomes impossible to discharge the obligation
in the proper way without the debtor's default, and at the same time
’ without entirely releasing the latren e. g. where the obligation is to
convey a res aliena which the owner will not seli (Dig. 3o 71. 3) he must
accept its value. By Nov. 43 Justinian enacted that if a person was
absolutely unable to pay a money debt, he might compe] the creditor to
select an equivalent from his property, provided he gave security against
eviction.

Solutio must be made to either the creditor in person orbis agent;
guardians and persons solutionis causa adiecti (e. g. mihi aut Titio dare
spondes? Tit. ¹9· 4 supr.) were regarded as his mandataries. lf the
debtor was unable to pay the creditor, either because he could not find
him, or because the latter refused to accept payment, or from uncertainty
as to who his real creditor was, he could release himself by deposit in
court, Cod. 8. 43. 9, Dig. 18. 6. r. a Payment by the fideiussor released
the principal only if the former had not previously procured an assign-
ment to himself of the creditor's rights against him (p. 413 supa). lf the
suretysbip took the form of mandatum it was never so, Dig. 17. r. 28 : cf.
note on Tit. 26. 5 supr.
