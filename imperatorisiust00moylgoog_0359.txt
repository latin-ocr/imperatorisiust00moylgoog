provided that grandchildren and still remorer descendants should rank as
liberi of their maternal grandparents or paternal grandfather, etc, in lieu
of their mother, father, etc, their portion, however, being diminished by
one third in favour of liberi admitted hythe earlier law, or if there vere
none, by one fourth in favour of the agnates. This last deduction
was abolished by Justinian in Cod. 6. 55. ra, and that of the third by
Nov. 18. 4.

It may beas well to state brieflythe rules of intestate succession where
the deceased was a filiusfamilias with peculium or an emancipatus. In
respect of peculium adventitium, Theodosius and Valentinian enacted
that (1) bona materna should go to the pater, (a) lucra nuptialia to the
children of the deceased filiusfamilias, the pater having the usufruct for
life : in default of children to the pater, and failing him to brothers and
sisters. Leo and Anthemius postponed the pater to brothers and sisters,
even of the half blood. Justinian extended these rules relating to lucra
nuptialia to bona materna and materni generis in their integrity, Cod 6.
59. 11, and later still to 311 peculium adventitium from whatever source
derived.

For the earlier law relating to peculium castrense see on Bk. ii. q pr.
supr. In Justinian’s time brothers and sisters as well as children of the
deceased were preferred to the pater (Bk. ii. 12. pr. supr. ‘sivero in·
testati decesserint, nullis liberis vel fratribus superstitibus, ad parentes
eorum iure communi pertinebit :³ cf. Cod. 6. 61.3 and 4), who took the
peculium only if there were none to precede him. The same mles
governed the succession to peculium quasi castrense
