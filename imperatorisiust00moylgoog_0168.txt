mento heres existat, tamdiu ex isdem legibus tutor petendus
crat, qui desinebat tutor esse, si condicio existeret aut dies

recipiunt diem vel condicionem, velut emancipatio, acceptilatio, heredi·
tatis aditio, servi optio, datio libertatis, in totum vitiantur per temporis
vel condicionis adiectionem' Dig. 50. 17. 77. When the condition was
satisfied or lulfilled, it was said, condicio existit: when it was certain
that it had not been lulfilled, conditio delicit. N egative conditions are
fullilled when the sact or event whose non-occurrence is contemplated
has become impossible ; and in some cases a condition was regarded as
fulfilled when in point ol lact it had not been : (1) ‘iure civili receptum est,
quotiens per eum, cuius interest condicionem non impleri, liat quominus
impleatur, perinde haberi ac si impleta condicio luisset’ Dig. 42. 1. 161.
(2) ll the sulhlment ol the condition is prevented by some other person’s
arbitrarily refusing consent or co-operation, ‘plerumque haec condicio, si
uxorem duxerit, si dederit, si fecerit, ita accipi oportet, quod per eum non
stet, quominus ducat, det aut laciat' Dig. 28. 7. 23: or il the person
entitled on t'ulfihuent is prevented lrorn sultilling by other accidental cir·
cumstances.

As regards the effect oi a condition annexed to a disposition:

(a) ll suspensive, the disposition, until it is lulfilled‚ is there and in
existence, and does not come into existence only on its sulfilment: ac·
cordingly, it may have legal consequences even though, through sailure
ol the condition, it is subsequently annihilated: e. g. a second will, in
which the heir is instituted sub condicione, revokes a prior one, even

though the condition is never lulfilled and the will as a whole thus never ·

takes effect, Dig. 28. 3. 16. But rights conlerred by the disposition are
merely conditional, and can have no practical effect until the condition is
fulhlled: speaking precisely, there is only a chance ol having the right,
which chance by the lulfilment ol the condition becomes an actuality : a
contingent becomes a vested right.

(b) lt resolutive, the disposition has presently all the ellects which it
would have, had it been unconditional, though these are liable to be can·
celled aad rendered null by the future fulfilment of the condition.

On the lulfilment os a suspensive condition, the disposition which has
hitherto been conditional becomes unconditionally operative, and its
operation is carried back to the time at which it was made: ‘cum enim
semel condicio extitit, perinde habetur ac si illo tempore, quo stipulatio
interposita est, sine condicione lacta esset' Dig. 20. 4. 10. 11 2 this rule is
expressed in the formula ‘condicio existens ad initium negotii retrotra-
hitur.' On the fulfilment os a resolutive condition, the whole effect of the
disposition is nullified, the condition operating retroactively so as to
place the parties as far as possible in the position in which they would
bave been had the disposition never been made3 Dig. 6. 1. 41 ; 13. 7.
13. pr. ; 18. 2. 43. For the effect ol impossible conditions see on Bk. ii.
14 ro inl. and cl. Blr. iii. 19. 11.

By dies, in connection with dispositions, is meant the fixing of a time,
which rnay mark either (a) the commencement ol a right : (b) its termina·
