being made praefectus praetorio, next to that of the princeps the
highest post in the empire, and throughout which he maintained
a moral rectitude andan integrity of character to which he owed his
farne no less than to his distinction as a lawyer. After Caracalla
(n. o. 21 1-217) had murdered his brother Geta, he called upon Papi-
nian to justify the deed before the senate and people; but the jurist
replicd that to accuse a man who had been wrongfully put to death
was as good as to murder him a second time, and steadily refused to
speah a word in the emperors hehalf; the refusal cost him his head
From his writings there are five hundred and ninety-tive excerpts in the
Digest, hut this number is no criterion of the authority which he
enjoyed in legal circles. Contemporary with Papinian was Domitius
Ulpianus, who wrote principally under Caracalla, and became prae-
torian prefect to Heliogabalus (218-22'2 n. n.); he met with a violent
death at the hands of the soldiers under his command in nn. aaa.
Owing to the large number ol his writings which were extant in the ·
time of Justinian, the aggregate of extracts from thern (2462) in the
Digest exceeds that from any other jurist; in fact he contributed to
that compilation nearly one-third of its contents. Julius Paulus, who
sat in the council of Septimius Sevems (198-211 n. n.) and was prae*
fectus praetorio under Alexander, was author of the receptae senten-
tiae, and is represented in the Digest by two thousand and eighty
passages. The series of classical jurists closes with Herennius Mo·
destinas, a pupil of Ulpian, and teacher of the young Maximinus
about nn. 238, frorn whose writings the Digest contains three hundred
and forty-five extracta.

After this tedious enumeration of the names of the most celebrated
jurists, we may turn aside to consider briefly the nature of their
influence and the modes in which it was exercised‚ including their
stylesofteaching andos legal treatment The establishment of the
empire brought with it a considerable change in respect of the
responsa prudentium. Under the free Republic it had been competent
to any one to profess the law, and to give advice on consultation;
¹the fonn and effect of the responsa had been under no limitatione.
The influence of the jurists was one which the emperors would
naturally find it difficult to destroy, not only because by its long and
steady growtb it bad achieved a stature and a traditional position
which might have long defied the direct attacks of opponents, but
because it had always been independent of political rank, and un·
connected with any constitutional office through which it might have
been assailed. The craft ol Augustus suggested the scheme ol
