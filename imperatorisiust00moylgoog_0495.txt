But, even long before the time of Gaius, the character of expensilatio
(with which, as a formal contract, stipulatio may be coordinated) had
been vitally altered. These two contracte had for centuries resembled
the English Deed in imposing an obligation by their mere form: once
made, the debtor was bound, and must pay, whether he had or had
not received the consideration for which he purported to have made
the promise or consented to the entry, anderen though his promise
or consent had been obtained by duress‚ fraud, or misrepresentation.
Some time, however, before Cicero, a praetor by name Cassius (Dig.
44. 4. 4. 33), had introduced the exceptio doli mali, by which a man,
when sued on aformal contract vitiated by want of consideration or
of good saith generally, was enabled to repel the plaintitf. In con·
tracts which were bonae fidei such a formal plea was unnecessary:
for ‘doli exceptio inest bonae fidei iudiciis' Dig. 24. 3. ar; and in a
condictio brought on a mutuum the defence of no consideration would
be a direct traverso of the plaintiff's right, upon whom consequentiy
would fall the burden of showing that the money had in point of fact
been advanced to the defendant. Mr. Poste (Gaius p. 389) seems to
think that the exceptio doli was not universally pleahable to condic·
tiones until the time of Marcus Aurelius ; but the passage in the Insti-
tutes (Bk. iv. 6. 30) upon which this supposition is based relates only
to the application of this plea in the introduction of a setoff (compen-
satio) in such suits. Itis obvious that Cassius' innovation entirely
changed the material character of stipulatio and expensilatio. Osten-
' sibly, they continued to bind in virtue of their form alone: practically,
as fraud, absence of consideration, etc. would enable the promisor, by
pleading exceptio doli, to defeat any action brought against him by

the other party, they were ‘transformed into real contracts, the obli· ,
galion of the promisor depending on the performance of the promisee ¹
(re), thetis, on the execution by the promisee of his part of the con·

sideration, not on the solemnity of the spoken words (verbis) or writ-
ten documents (literis).'

Eventually, when the defendant's plea was in effect that the pro-
mised pecuniary consideration, by which his own promise had been
obtained, had not, in point of fact, been¹ given (ie. when it was in
factum composita), it came to be called the exceptio pecuniae non
numeratae, which Justinian says in the Code is a species of the excep·
tio doli, with which indeed it is in Cod. 4. 30. 3 actually identified:

cf. notes on Bk. iv. 13. r and a inf. From a comparison of Gaiusir. ,
116 with those paragraphs it would seem that the new name had not ’

yet been given in the former’s time. Upon the plea of pecunia non
