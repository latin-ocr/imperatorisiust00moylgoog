CAPITIS DEMINUTIO.

Urow the nature oi capitis deminutio minima a different view is
maintained by Savigny from that adopted in the note on Blr. i. 16. 3.
He argues that the essence oi all capitis deminutio is a degradation‚
or ‘ downward step on the ladder of status! As applied to the two
higher modes (maxima and media) this theory is not out of accord
with the laets ε there can be no doubt that a sree man who became a
slave, or a civis who became Latinus or peregrinus, was thereby
degraded to a lower civil position. As applied, however, to capitis
deminutio minima it presents insuperable difficulties: it is neither
established by the authorities, nor can the inierences which must
logically be drawn from it bc reconciled with the statements ol the
jurists and other writers.

(1) On Savigny’s hypothesis capitis deminutio minima occurred
only in two cases: (α) where a person sui iuris passed into potestas
or manus: (b) where a filiusfamilias, or woman in manu, was con-
veyed into the condition ol mancipium in order thereby tube emanci-
patedor given in adoption. Accordingly, the children olan adrogatus
will not be capite minuti when they pass along with him into the
potestas and lamilia of the adrogator: yet the very opposite ol this
is stated by Paulus in Dig. 4. 5. 3 ‘liberos qui adrogatum parentem
sequuntur placet minui caput, cum in aliena potestate sunt, etcum
familiam mutaverint! Savigny boldly says that Paulus was wrong,
that his view is unsupported by any other jurist, and is in lact
peculiar to himself ε but he seems to have overlooked the force of
the word ‘placet’ which certainly means ‘is the received doctrine'
(ι verbum de iure antea controverso, iurisconsultorum responsis sta·
bilito, sollemne’ Schrader), and it can hardly be doubted that il Paulus
had been stating his own individual opinion he would have said ‘ puto,’
or ‘videtur mihi! On this point Savigny is altogether unsupported
by textual authority.

(2) On Savigny's hypothesis a woman who passed in manum was
capite minuta only il she were stri iuris before the conventio in manum,
not il she were already in potestas. But this distinction is quite
