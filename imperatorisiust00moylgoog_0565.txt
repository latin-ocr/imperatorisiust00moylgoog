550 Irl'STITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Linlv. ³

divae memoriae loquitur constitutio: sin autern quantitate vel ,
alio modo plus suerit petitum, omne, si quid forte damnum ex

section, was an equitable remedy introduced by the praetor through
the edict, which in the lonnulary period had been perhaps the most
striking example ol his extraordinaria cognitio. Its firnmion had been
the rescission, in this or that concrete case, ol rights and duties rusulting
” lrom the operation ol the ordinary law, because under tbe special cir·
cumstances equity so required, exactly as equity in England gave relies,
for instance, against mistake, when law afforded no remedy whatever.
And this rescission was effected by the direct and immediate action os
the magistrate ; it was an exereise ol his imperium, not ot' his iurisdictio:
in integrum restitutio in its proper sense being thus distinguished from
analogous cases in which a restoration occurred either ipso iure (as in
postliminium) or by the remedial process ol the ordinary law.

The conditions under which in integrum restitutio could be applied lor
are as lollow: ,

(r) The applicant must have suffered a prejudice (laesio) from the
operation of law, which may be lucrum cessans no less than damnum
incidens, Dig. 44 7.6 ; 4. 6. 27, but which need not be strictly proprietam
Dig.4 4. 3. 6; lor examples see notes on ἕξ 4and 5 supr, Bk ii. 15. 5
supr, Gaius iv. 57. On the principle ‘de minimis non curat lex’ it
seems also to have been requisite that the laesio should not be merely
trivial

(2) The mere existence ol a laesio in itseli is insufficient; there must ·

also be a ground (iusta causa) upon which the application is based.
These are six in number: ‘integri restitutionem praetor tribuit ex his
causis quae per metum, dolum, et status permutationem, et iustum
errorem, et absentiam necessariam, et infirmitatem aetatis gesta esse
dicuntur' Paul. sent. rec. 1. 7. 2; cs. Dig.4.1.1.

The restitutio of a minor (ie. person under twenty-five years of age)
was independent, if he were also impubes, it his guardian's auctoritas
having been given to the disposition against which he appealed, Cod. 5.
71. 11, except where it was payment to him os a debt, Dig. 4. 4 7. 2 3 and
under exceptional circumstances he could not obtain restitutio at all, eg.
where he had represented himself as of full age, Cod. 2¹45. 1; where
the person against whom he claimed it was also a minor, Dig.4 4. 11. 6;
and where he had contracted a money loan at his sather's order, Dig.
ib. 3. 4.

Upon any of the remaining five causae a person ol lull age could get
himself restitutus no less than a minor.

ln integrum restitutio was not the only form ot' relies obtainable
where one had been induced to make a disposition by intimidation or
fraud. Dolus had always been a sufficient defence in a bonae fidei action,
and it was made pleadable l in the lorm ol an exceptio) to actions stricti
iuris by a praetor called Cassius, Dig. 44. 4. 4. 33. In uc. 71 a praetor
Ι named Octavius introduced the actio and exceptio quod metus causa,
and finally, five years later, Gallus Aquilius added the actio doli.
