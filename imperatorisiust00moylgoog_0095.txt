does the ‘ius quod ad personas pertinet' follow these differences into
¹ all their consequences. It points them out ; but the effect of them,
in the law of property and obligation, is left to be treated elsewhere,
or, as is most commonly the case, is not treated at all ¹.

As to the status of liberty the non-free are not ‘persons' and
therefore it might seem that they should be passed over. But some
mention is necessary (Title 3) of the modes in which men can become
slaves; and, again, slaves are capable of becoming ‘persons' by
liberation, and therefore the ways in which this can taire place are
described (Title 5), and some account is given of the grounds on
which manumission is prohibited by positive law (Titles 6 and 7) as
also ol restrictions imposed on the powers of masters over their slaves
(Title 8). Moreover, the precise effect of manumission had depended
on the form of the act, the age of the master and the slave, and the
character of the latter; sreedmen had thus not always been of the
same kind, and means had been provided to enable them to rise from
alower grade in their class to a higher ; but these distinctions, though
referred to by Justinian, were abolished by him (Title 5), and the law
was thereby much simplilied, though the division os freemen into free·
bom (ingenui) and sreedmen (libertini) still remained‚ and had import-
ant consequences in the law of successim, which are detuiled in
Book iii. Title 7.

The status of civitas, being historically of importance mainly in
relation to public law, is not treated independently under the ius
personarum by either Gaius or Justinian. It would nothe difficult to
explain this in the latter, in whose time a peregrinus was a rara avis,
and the ius civile had been so swallowed up in the ius gentium that
the distinction between citizen and foreigner‚ in respect of private
rights, was merely microscopic. But in the age of Gaius peregrini

¹ This appears to be the point in which the writers who have been referred to
have gone astray. They would have been correct in defining the ‘law of Persons'
as ¹ the law of Unequals' or ‘Ahuormai law' if they had conlined it to the mere
description of differeuces between Persona, in virtue of which some were· Unequal'
or ‘Abnormal ;' but they have further made it follow up the consequences of such
inequality in respect of property, contract, and dispositione generally. Thus, in
the ‘law of Persons,’ Austin would uot only describe infancy us a fact which
modihed a person's capacity of right and disposition, but-he would proeeed to
enumerate the points of modification: e. g. an infant's incapacity to make a valid
conveyance. give a valid receipt, or bind himself by contract. But, though Gaius
and Justinian enumerate, among the differences between Persona, that of sui and
alieni iuris, they spealr of the filiusfamilias’ proprietary capacity in Bte ii, and of
the effect of his contracta iu Bks. iii. and iv, under the ius quod ad res, or ad
actiones pertinet.
