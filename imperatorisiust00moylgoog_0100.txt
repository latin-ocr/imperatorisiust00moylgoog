INTRODUCTION TO BOOK I. 85

Between the private law of Rome as stated by Gaius, and as stated
by Justinian, there is far more differenoe in the matter of personae
and actiones than in the intennediate department, the ‘ius quod ad res
pertinet,' except perhaps in such part of the latter as relates to inherit-
ance or successioni. The most important points of change in tbe
subject now under our immediate consideration are brielly as follows:
(ι) The threefold division of libertini into cives, Latini, and dediticii,
which was important when Gaius wrote, was practically obsolete in
the time of Justinian, who formally abolisbed it; this necessitated a
change in the law of manumission, which was greatly simplified, the
statutes which had introduced these distinctions being to that extent
repeaied, as also was the lex Fufia Caninia, limiting the number of
slaves who could be manumitted by testament; (a) of persons ‘alieno
iun' subiectae,' exclusive ol slaves there had in Gaius’ time been three
classes, viz. those in paternal power, those in manu, and those in
mancipio. In the institutes patria potestas is still a living reality, but
manus and mancipium have become obsolete ; hence a second
simplification, the modes in which manus could arise, and some of the
purposes for which it had been employed, being a somewhat compli-
cated and difficolt branch of law. (3) In Justinian legitimation of chil-
dren not under patria potestas at birth is definitely treated as one of the
modes in which this power may originate; in Gaius' time this occurred
only by the fact of a Latinus acquiring the civitas, and by his children
born before this event being subjected to his potestas ; but in the
later period there were no Latini ; and accordingly the long discussion
iu Gaius (i. 65-96) ‘de statu liberorum,’ and on the modes in which
a Latin could become a civis, has no counterpart in Justinian except
the paragraph on legitimation in i. ro. 13 ς (4) with regard to adop-
tion sensu stricto, Justinian completely altered its form, and also its
effect unless the adopting person was a natural ascendant; with
regard to ‘adrogatio' the form had been changed between the two
vnoers, it being now effected ‘principali rescripto,' not ‘populi
auctoritate‚’ as in the time of Gaius; but no other change of any
great importance had been made in this branch of law. (5) Justinian
entirely changed the mode of emancipation (i. 12. 6.) by substituting
for the old fictitious sale a mere declaration by the parent before a
magistrate. (6) In the department of guardianship the ‘perpetua
mulierum tutela' with which, though still existing in bis day, Gaius
(i 190) had expressed his dissatisfaction, had altogether disappeared
long before the compilation of the Corpus Iuris. The expression
‘fiduciaria tutela' has also changed its signification (see notes on
