436 INSTITUIIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Liblll.

lex eo obligatio nec mandati inter vos actio nascitur. Man-
dantis tantum gratia intervenit mandatum, veluti si quis tibi
mandet, ut negotia eius gereres vel ut fundum ei emeres, vel
2ut pro eo sponderes. Tua et mandantis, veluti si mandet
tibi, ut pecuniam sub usuris crederes ei, qui in rem ipsius
mutuaretur, aut si volente te agere cum eo ex fideiussoria
causa mandet tibi, ut cum reo agas periculo mandantis, vel ut
ipsius periculo stipularis ab e0, quem tibi deleget in id quod
stibi debuerat. Aliena autern causa intervenit mandatum,

§L Τὴε use of ‘sponderes' is mere pedantry; in Dig. 17. r. 2. 13
ib. 6. 2 ; ib. 8. 8, and other passages relating to this subject, we read only
of fideiussi0. ’ The second os the three instances given here may be
illustrated thus. A becomes surety (fideiussor) to you sor B, who oves
y'ou 5ol.: on your proposing to sue him on this contract os suretyship,

“ Ἴτε commissions you (mandat) to sue B, the principal debtor, in lieu os
him at his (Αέ) risk. This is to A's interest, because he is protected
from your action at any rate sor a time, an advantage which he could not
have otherwise secured, as Nov. 4 had not yet introduced the beneficium
ordinis (p. 413 supr.) ; and he is altogether so protected if B proves solvent.
1t is to your interest, because the mandate may and probably will contain
more favourable conditions than the fideiussio, eg. the security os a hy·
potheca (inrddou γὰρ ὅτι ἡ e'yydn γέγονε δίχα ὑποθήκης, τὸ δὲ μάνδατον μετὰ
ὑποθήκης Theoph.), and before Justinian's legislation it would have been
most advantageous to you is you had been in doubt which was solvent,
A or B, for in virtue of it you could first sue B without risle, and then, if
he proved to have insufficient assets, you could sue A by actio mandati,
which you could not have done by action on the guaranty, because he
was released as fideiussor by litis contestatio with B. This was remedied
by Justinian in Cod. 8. 42. 28 ‘generaliter sancimus, quemadmodum in
mandatoribus statutum est, ut, contestatione contra unum ex his lacta,
alter non liberetur, ita et in fideiussoribus observari.³

To explain the third instance we will suppose that A owes 501. to B,
who owes the same sum to C. B gives a commission to C to stipulata
from A at his (Βέ) rislr that he (A) will pay him (C) the 501. which he
owes B ; ‘delegare est vice sua alium reum dare creditori vel cui iusserit¹
Dig. 46. 2. 11. As Mr. Poste points out, the result oi this transaction‚
compounded ol mandate and stipulation‚ is two novations‚ extinguish'rng
the original debts of A to B, and B to C, 3ηά creating two new liabilities,
a debt of 50l. owed by A to C, and a mandate between B and C under
which B is guarantor os A; it is to B’s interest, because he is released
from the action on the debt to C, which might bave been stricti iun‘s,
3ηά to which he was immediately liable, and can only be sued, if at all,
by actio mandati, which is bonae fidei ; it is favourable to C, because he
thereby gets two debtors (a principal and a surety) instead of one.

§8. ls A commissioned B to do something sor C, he had no rights
