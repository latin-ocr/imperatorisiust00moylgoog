tiara] DE MILITARI TESTAMENTO. 241

libus remissa est. narn quamvis hi neque legitimum numerum
testium adhibuerint neque aliam testamentorum sollemnitatem
observaverint, recte nihilo minus testantur, videlicet cum in
expeditionibus occupati sunt: quod merito nostra constitutio
induxit. quoquo eninr modo voluntas eius suprema sive
scripta inveniatur sive sine scriptura, valet testamentum ex
voluntate eius. illis autem temporibus, per quae citra expe·

oi testamentary form dates from the time oi Julius Caesar. A soldier’s
will (1) if written, did not require to be witnessed at all: ἀμαρτύρους. ..

Leonis 40, though§ r, ‘convocatis ad boc hominibus‚’ might seem to
imply the contrary : (2) ii oral, could not stand if the alleged heir was the
only witness, § r. By the enactment to which he refers (Cod. 6. 21. 7)
Justinian allowed the exercise oi this privilege by a soldier only while he
was in camp or barraclrs on actual service (this being the meaning oi
expeditio in the text), not while on furiough: aad a will so executed
remained in soree only one year aster his discharge, §3inr., and even lost
all validity ii the discharge was ‘with ignominy.'

lt was not merely in respect oi form that soldiers' wills were privileged
They were not bound by the rule ‘nemo pro parte testatus, pro parte
intestatus decedere potest’ Tit. 14. 5 ini, or by the lex Falcidia and
similar enactments relating to fideicommissa: they need not sormally
disinherit their children, Tit. 13. 6 inf, Cod. 3. 29. 8, nor were their wills
avoided by their undergoing capitis deminutio (§ sini, Dig. 28. 3. 6. 6):
they could institute as heirs persons who could not inherit from an
ordinary testator (Gaius ii. 110), and could dispose of the inheritance by
codicils‚ Dig. 29.1. 36.

The wills of certain other persons besides soldiers were privileged in
the matter oi form. By an enactment oi Justinian the general law might
in rural districts be overidden by local custom, and signature by the wit-
nesses was dispensed with if it was difficult to find seven who could write,
and even five were held enough ii more could not be got, Cod. 6. 23. 31.
Where a man disposed of his property solely in favour oi his own de-
scendantshis will, ii written, need notbeattested (‘testamentum parentium

inter liberos' Nov. 107. r).
