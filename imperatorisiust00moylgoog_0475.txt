EXCURSUS V.

THE GENERAL NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS.

Trur term obligatio properly indicates a legal relation between two
definite persons, whereby the one (creditor, Dig. 50. 16. 11, and ra.
pr.) is entitled to a certain act or forbearance on the part ol the
other (debitor). The contrast between it and the relation existing
in the case os ownership, possession, or other legal rights is well
marked by Paulus in Dig. 44. 7. 3. pr. ‘obligationum substantia non
in eo consistit, ut aliquod corpus nostrum, aut servitutem nostram
iaciat, sed ut alium nobis obstringat ad dandum aliquid, vel faciendum,
vel praestandum,' with which may be compared Bk. iv. 6. rinl.
‘namque agit unus quisque aut cum eo, qui ei obligatus est . ..quo
casu proditae sunt actiones in personam . . . aut cum eo agit qui nullo
iure ei obligatus est, movet tamen alicui de aliquare controversiam,
quo casu proditae actiones in rem sunt’ No better explanation ol
this contrast can be found than Austin's exposition of the difference
between rights in rem and rights in personam, the meritos which,
however, is marred by his use of the term obligation to denote the
duty corresponding to rights of the former as well as ol the latter
class.

But though this is the proper and normal meaning ol the term,
obligatio is sometimes used in other senses, and more especially to
express one or other limb of the relation in contradistinction to the
other; thus, it signifies the right of the creditor only in the common
phrase adquirere obligationem (Bk. iii. 28, Dig.45. 1. 126. ²3 23· 3.
46: cf. Blr. ii. a. a supa), and the duty ol the debitor only in Dig. ra.
1. 3⁶3 46. 1. 5. 21, ib. 3. 95. 3, as well as in the definition given in
Bk. iii. 13. pr. supr. Sometimes it denotes specifically the act or
event lr'orn which the relation arises, as in Cod. 11. 47. aa, Dig. a.
14. 1. 3, as well as in the expressions verborum obligatio, litteramm
obligatio, ete. Again, though onlya person can properly be ‘obli-
gatus‚' obJects which are pledged are occasionally spoken ol by
analogy as subject to au obligation, e.g. Bk. iii. 27. a supr, Dig. ao.
