148 INS TIT UTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. l.

4 suerunt, coeperunt alieno iuri subiecti esse, vel contra. Servus
autem manumissus capite non minuitur, quia nullum caput

capite non minuuntur: et ideo senatu motos capite non minui

minutus, of his previous agnatic family. lt is defined in this passage
(which is taken frorn Gaius i. 162) as a status commutatio, a change of
status unaccompanied by any loss of liberty or citizenship. Similarly
Paulus says in Dig. 4. ς. 11 ‘curn et libertas et civitas retinetur, familia
tantum mutatur, minimam esse capitis deminutionem constat,’ ib. 3
‘liberos qui adrogatum parentem sequuntur, placet minui caput, quum
in aliena potestate sunt, et quum familiam mutaverint‚' ib.7 ‘tutelas
etiarn non amittit capitis minutio: sed legitimae tutelae ex duodecim
tabulis intervertuntur eadem ratione, quaet hereditates exinde legitimae,
quia adgnatis deferuntur, qui desinunt'esse familia mutati ;' cf. ‘minima
capitis deminutio est, per quarn et civitate et libertate salva status dun·
taxat hominis mutatur· Ulpian, reg. 11. 13. The practical coincidence
of Gaius and Ulpian with Paulus in describing capitis deminutio minima
as a mere change, and not necessarily a change for the worse, involving
a degradation, and the fact that they differ from him only in being less .
clear and emphatic in their definition, is noteworthy‚ because writers
who take a different view upon this subject from that here adopted
contend that Paulus is the only jurist by whose writings the latter is
supported.

ln the law of Justinian’s time, then, capitis deminutio minima occurred
in the following cases: (1) where a person sui iuris became alieni iuris
by adrogatio, legitimatio, and revocatio in patriam potestatem propter in·
gratitudinem. lt may be objected that a person who is adrogated or
legitimated may stand by himself in the world, and therefore have no
familia to leave: but to this it may be replied that the Roman law
regarded such a person as having a familia in virtue of his capacity to
create one by marrying and begetting children, ‘ . . . idemque eveniet et in
eo qui emancipatus est : namet hic sui iuris effectus propriam familiam
habet' Dig. 50. 16. 195. 2. (a) Where a person alieni iun's entered a new
family, e. g. the filiusfamilias given in adoptio piena, and the children of
an adrogatus, legitimatus, or in patriam potestatem revocatus. (3) Where
a person alieni became sui iuris by emancipation. For a discussion of
another view upon this subject see Excursus l at the end of Book l, and
for the effect of capitis deminutio minima on adrogatus' property, debts,
etc. see Blc iii. to 3 and notes inf.

§h So status and dignitas are distinguished by Ulpian in Dig. 1. 5. 20
‘qui furere coepit, et statum et dignitatern in qua fuit et magistratum
et potestatem videtur retinere, sicut rei suae dominium retinet’

Every Roman citizen was held in virtue of his citizenship to possess

a certain dignity called his existimatio, which remained untamished and
