Tit. ru] DE SATISDATJONJBUS. 569

minus rem suam ipsi exsequi possint. Procurator neque certis 1
verbis neque praesente adversario, immo plerumque ignorante
eo constituitur: cuicumque enim permiseris rem tuam agere
aut defendere, is procurator intellegitur· Tutores et curatores 2
quemadmodum constituuntur, primo libro expositum est.

DE SATISDATIONIBUS·

Satisdationum modus alius antiquitati placuit, alium novitas
mmmmmm

Olim enim si in rem agebatur, satisdare possessor com-
pellebatur, ut, si victus nec rem ipsam restitueret nec litis
aestimationem, potestas esset petitori aut cum eo agendi
aut cum fideiussoribus eius. quae satisdatio appellatur
iudicatum solvi: unde autem sic appellatur, facile est intel-

out to be, this form of representation was released from the incon·
venientes which previously had attended it, Tit. ιι. 3 inf. Hence arose
more formal, though of course still optional, modes of appointing such
agents, the observance of which would place their authority beyond all
doubt ; e. g. nomination in court, Tit. ιι. 4 inf.; registration in the acta,
ib. 3, or a written notification addressed to the one party hythe other,
coupled with an undertaking to ratify the agent’s proceedingS‚ Dig. 3. 3.
65 3 and it became a recognised rule that where the principal's authority
was delegated in any of these modes his right of action was consumed,
Dig. 44 2. 11. 7, and be could himself bring, orbe sued by, the actio
iudicati, fragm. Vat. 331, 332. The latter action could still be brought
against a procurator who was condemned (unless he was appointed in
court, Tit. rat inf), but apparently he could defend himself by the
exceptio doli

The word ‘quemlibet’ in the first line of the Title is not literally true ;
women and soldiers could be procurators only in rem suam, Tit. 13. 11
inf. 5 and persons branded with infamia could neither be represented
by agents themselves, frag. Vat. 322, nor as a rule act as agents, except
‘pro libertate’ ib. 3²⁴·

§a Under the older law tutors and curators had been treated like
procuratum, and required to give security both ‘ratam rem dominum
habiturum’ and ‘iudicatum solvi ;' though Gaius tells us, iv. 99 (cf. Tit.
11. pr. inf), that they were sometimes excused. Under justinian they
stood on the same footing with procurators whose appointment had been
formal, Dig. 26. 7. 2. pr.

att. ΧΙ. Satisdatio is properly a species of recognisance entered into
