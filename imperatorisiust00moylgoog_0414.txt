daturum facturumve quid spoponderit, non obligabitur, veluti
si spondeat Titium quinque aureos daturum. quodsi effecturum
se, ut Titius daret, spoponderit, obligatur. Si quis alii, quarn 4

cium by the stipulator: cs. ini. ‘commercium adipisci stipulator.¹ For the
ground of nullity ol such a condition as ‘si ex libero servus fiat,' already
stated on § 1, cs. Dig. 45. 1. 83. 5 ‘ut ne haec quidem stipulatio de
homine libero probanda sit, illurn cum servus erit dare spondes? .. . quia
ea duntaxat quae natura sua possibilia sunt deducuntur in obligationem,
... et casum adversamque fortunam spectari hominis liberi neque civile
neque naturale est,’ Dig. 50. 17. 29 ‘quod initio vitiosum est, non potest
tractu temporis convalescere.¹ A stipulation sor conveyance ol res sua
which the stipulator believed to be aliena was void because ‘id quod

ut stet.¹

(2) B will be bound (a) if A is his messenger, intermediam, or agent:
see Excursus lX at the end of this Boolr. 1r A acts as his negotiorum
gestor (unauthorized agent) and B refuses to ratify, A is answerable sor
loss accruing to the promisee only ii the latter believed him to be
authorized3 (b) ii he is A's heir : sor this see ξ 13 and notes ins.

Sometimes, however, a person incurred liabllity under a contract in
which he was not directly a party, and was not even so much as named :
in particular (a) the paterfamilias or dominus on certain contracts oi his
son or slave, Bk. iv. 7 ins.; (b) the principal on contractsmade for him
by his agent, authorized or unauthorized (Cod 4. 26. 7. 1.), and (c) the
