COMITIA CENTURIATA-PLEBEIAN SECESSIONS. 9

which underlay its applicatior'r to this branch of the national lile was
this-that a man ought to have an influence in public affairs pro-

, portioned to the burdens which he bore in delending the state

against its external soes. This idea could not be realised in either
of the two assemblies already existing; lor in the one no plebeian,
in the other no patrician, ever so much as appeared. The result
wasthe establishment of a third comitia, the comitia centuriata, which
was destined, sor most purposes, to eventually throv the other two
into the shade, and to engross the discussion os public questions,
such as war and peace, legislation on matters affecting the con-
stitution, the choice oi magistrates, and the decision ol all judicial
proceedings which involved the ‘caput’ oi a Roman citizen. In the
comitia centuriata, where each century had a single vote, the in·
fiuence oi the richer middle class had an irresistlble preponderance.
ln the order which lurnished cavalry, the patrician votes were out-
numbered in the proportion oi two to one by those oi the plebeians;
while the eighty votes of the first os Servius’ infantry classes lormed
a compact political force which could lose or win the day in a con·
tested electiori, oron a public question upon which opinions differed.
The political, however, were not precisely identical with the military
centuries; the proportion between the classes was the same, but by
the addition oi a proletariate suffrage the number ol military com-
panies was exceeded by the number of votes in the comitia by one.

With the expulsion oi the sons of Tarquinius Superbus (circ. 509
ac.) the kingly govemment ol Rome carne to an end. The act had
been that ol the patricians; but the plebeians were in fult accord with
them, and to the harmony between the leaders of the two parties was
due the introduction oi the Servian constitution by the leges Valeriae,
and in particular ol the comitia centuriata, with all the powers and
privileges lately enumerated. The constitutional fonctions oi the
lring were vested in two supreme magistrates of co-ordinate authority,
who were chosen from year to year, and called at first praetors, and
later consuls3 of the first two who were elected one was the plebeian
L. Junius Brutus. It would seem too that the plebeians now gained
the entra to the senate-at least, henceiorward two classes of senators
are distinguished-patres and conscripti. But no provision ap·
parently was made to secure an adequate senatorial representation
ol the plebs, and alter Brutus there is no plebeian consul ior very
many years. This will make it clear at once that, though the plebs
commanded an overwhelrning majority in the comitia, its political
influence in general was sar less real than might be supposed. Α
