rule is non-essential, and does not affect the validity of the disposition,
which relates to the properties or name (Bk. ii. 20. ²9 supr, Cod. 6. ²3· 4)
os the person to whom the declaration ol intention relates, or to the name
or uon-essential properties os the thing, Dig. 30. 4. pr.; 34. 5. 28,
Cod. 6. 37. 7. 1.

In contracta mistake frequently leads to one party expressing an inten-
tion which does not agree with that expressed by the other, because the
first supposes the second’s real intention to be different from that which
he has expressed: (e. g. B offers to buy A's black horse, meaning black
horse a3 A thinks he means black horse β, and agrees to sell : he thinks
heis agreeing to B’s proposal, but in fact heis agreeing to a proposal
which B has never made.) Here there is no consent, for ‘non videntur
qui errant consentire' Dig. 50. 17. 116. 2, and an essential clement oi
contract is ‘duorum pluriumve in idem placitum consensus’ Dig. 2. 14. 1.
2. ln such cases the contract is void only if the mistake (ie the absence
of consent) is essential in the sense already stated (nature os the relation,
Dig. 12. 1. 18: person, ib. 32: thing, 18. 1. 9. prs: its properties, ib. 2).

Error in the sonnation of intention (or in motive) does not necessarily
avoid dispositions. Because one is induced to act by a mistake in
motive, the intention is none the less real ; or, in other words, unessen-
tial error, as a rule, leaves the disposition valid‚ however strongly it may
have operated as an inducement‚ Dig.12.1. 52; ib. 65. a. The chief
exception to this is in testamentary dispositions (Bk ii. 20. 31 and note
supr.): dispositions inter vivos are invalidated by such mistake only it
the latter was known to the party benefited by thern, and this approxi-
mates to fraud ll actual fraud on the others part produces the mistake,
the disposition is not ipso tacto void: but it sued upon the exceptio doli
can be pleaded, or the party deceived can claim by the actio doli to be
restored in statum quo.

§24 Cl. Dig. 45. 1. 26 ‘generaliter novimus, turpes stipulationes
nullius esse momenti,' 12. 5. 8 ‘si ob turpem causam promiseris Titio...
si petat, exceptione doli mali summovere eum possis,’ Cod. 8. 30. 4 ‘cum
omnia, quae contra bonos mores vel in pactum vel in stipulationem de-
ducuntur, nullius momenti sint! Unlawiul or immoral conditions were
treated in the same way as those which were impossible: they avoided
contracts: in testamentary dispositions they were taken ‘pro non scriptis,’
Dig. 28. 7.9 3ib. 14. and 16.
