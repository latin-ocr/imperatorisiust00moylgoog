THE GENERAL ΝΑ Τ URE OF OBLIGATIONS. 461

6. rr: a. 14. gna: 13· 7. 27, and lastly, in Cod. 4. 3⁰· 7, the term
bears the meaning of a bond or document attesting an obligation.

The immediate result of an obligatio is the partial subjection (in
law) of one person’s will to that of another: the partial limitation of
the debitor’s freedom of action in favour of the creditor. If I engage
to buy roool. Consols, Iam no longer at liberty to buy railway stoclr
with the same money: Ι must talre the Consols, or (which comes to
the same thing) I must pay damages: ‘debitor intellegitur is, a quo
invito pecunia exigi potest' Dig.5o.16.108; the prominent con-
ception is that expressed in the ‘necessitate adstringimur' of the
definition of obligation in the Institutes. As Savigny remarks, the
relation of obligation to personal freedom resembles that of servitude
to dominium: it is, as it were, so much deducted from the ideal
whole. But, as he also points out, the restrictiori must be partial
only; if a man’s freedom is not merely curtailed in favour of another,
but absolutely resigned, this is not obligation, but slavery.

The object or content of an obligation is an act or forbearance:
the debtor is bound either to do or not to do. The nature of this
act or forbearance requires some elucidation.

(r) The current Roman classification of the possible objects of
obligation is that suggested by the passage of Paulus cited above,
into dare, facere, and praestare: cf. Gaius iv. a ‘in personam actio
est . . . cum intendimus dare, facere, praestare oportere! Where one
person is bound to convey ownership in a definite object (certum)
to another, or to constitute inhia favour, in a mode recognised by
the civil law, a ius in re aliena, the obligation is ‘dare' By praestare
seems to be meant making compensation fora wrong: all other
obligations, including the majority of those arising ex contractu,
are ‘facere' It is obvious that this is not a scientific classification,
and it originated, in point of fact, in the technlcalities of pleading
under the formulary system, apart from which it is not easy to
understand: under justinian it is amere valueless survival of an older
and obsolete procedure.

(a) The act or forbearance must have an appreciable money value
in relation to the creditor, ‘ea enim in obligatione consistere, quae
pecunia lui praestarique possunt’ Dig. 40. 7. 9. a. This rule origi-
nated in the fact that under the formulary procedure the remedy in
a personal action was always damagm: there was no specific per·
formance, and if, on the debitor’s refusal to do that to which he was
bound, the creditor's only means of procuring satisfaction vas to
obtain a pecuniary condemnation, au obligation which could not be
