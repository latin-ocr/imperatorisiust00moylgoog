6 INTRODUCTION.

was that the plebs was made a participator in all those rights which,
in the later law, are usually described as the private rights involved in
the Roman civitas. Thus the plebeians had the commercium, and
could acquire property by mancipati03 they shared the family law of
Rome, except so far as this was oia public character ; that is to say,
such parts of family law as preserved and perpetuated the tie between
family and populus had no relation to thern whatever. The Roman
principle of political exclusion led to considerable results in the field
of pure law, it produced a duplication of institutions. Thus, the wife of
aplebeian could be in his manua, but they could not be married by
confarreatio, which was publici juris (see Commentary on i. 10 pr.):
hence the two other modes in which manus could be produced,
coemptio and usus <Gaius i. 110), may be conjectured to have been
of plebeian origin. Again, the plebeian could have his children under
his potestas, but it may be doubted whether he could adopt by adro-
gation, which was an aet of high political significance, effected in -the
comitia, hence it is probably to the plebs that we should ascribe the
form of adoption imperio magistratus (Inst. i. rr. r); finally, asa
plebeian could not, at any rate personally, submit his testament to the
comitia calata for legislative sanction, we may suppose that this was
the origin of tbe will ‘per aes et libram' (Gaius ii. 102), the validity of
which was expressly confirmed by the Twelve Tables. In fact, the
communication of private rights to the plebs led to a vast development
of private law. Had the Roman populus contrived to live apart by
itself in arrogant isolation ; had it stubbornly refused to recognise a
tittle oi right in any man who was not a member oi itself ; had it, in
short, not happily hit upon the device of separating the public from
the private portion of the ius Romanum, the history of Roman juris·
prudence would in all probability have been far different from what it
has been.

Under Servius Tullius, the constitution was to a great degree revo-
lutionised by two reforms, which in the end completely altered the
political centre of gravity. The importance of the plebs, on account
no less of its wealth and military use as infantry than of its numbers,
became daily more obvious; it was clear that the time at which its
political position should be recognised could not be long deferred. lt
was Servius, of whom it is related (Cic. de Republ. ii. ar) that he

Ι attained the royal dignity by plebeian support, who practically affected

its recognition. It has been already said that the plebs could not
possibly be brought within the politica] constitution by means of the
personal principle of family, gentile, and tribal connection. Servius
