§ 9. This is only an illustration of the rule·that the status of children
born of lawful wedloclr was determined at the time of their conception,
because they followed the condition of their father: ‘hi qui legitime con·
cipiuntur ex conceptionis tempore statum sumunt’ Gaius i. 89. On the
other hand, illegitimate children followed the condition of their mother,
being ‘spurii' Tit. ro. 12 supr, and accordingly in the time of Gaius
their condition was determined by her status at the time of birth: for
the later modification of this rule see Tit. 4, and note supr.

lf the potestas were terminated in some mode by which the filius·
familias underwent capitis deminutio, he ceased to belong to his previous
agnatic family, and thereby lost all his rights of intestato succession and
guardianship to its members: consequently the distinction between
modes in which this occurred and those in which it did not is im·
portant. The former are three in number: loss of libertas or civitas
(apert from the ius postliminii), emancipation, and subjection to some
other power, whether potestas, manus, or mancipium (e. g. the latter as

'nn 1111. Tutela was originally conceived rather as a right than as
a duty (whence the phrase ‘tutelam nancisci,’ Tit 12. 6. supr, Tit. ro

(Tit. 25. pr. inf), a function which the state required all its qualihed
members to discharge if called upon, and from which they could be ex·
