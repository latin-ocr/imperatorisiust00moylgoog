tion. This resembles the former, in that two or more creditore (correi
stipulandi or credendi) are entitled against one debtor, or two or more
debtors (correi promittendi or debendi) are bound to one creditor in
respect ol one and the same obligation-object, and so sar we may
say that every correal includes in itsell a solidary obligation, each oi
the two or more creditors being entitled, and each os the two or more
debtors being bound, in solidum. But it differs in that there is not
only one obligation-object, but only one oblegatrbn. The unity ol the
object here follows necessarily from the unity oi the obligation itsell:
where the liability is solidary, it arises from extraneous causes, lor,
given a variety os obligations, the natural and usual consequence
would be a corresponding variety ol' objects.

It is thus the unity or identity ol the obligation which distinguishes
correal from merely solidary obligation: or, to put the matter in
another form, when there is correality, there is, obJectively, one
single obligation, to which a variety ol persons are subjectively
related in solidum: and their subjective relation may be different.

There is, objectively, but one single obligation. Hence any act or ,
event (and not merely performance or its equivalent, asin cases ol
solidarity) which puts an end to the objective existence of that single
obligation between the creditor and one oi the debtors, or the debtor
’ and one ol the creditore, extinguishes it between them all; e. g. solutio
or performance, acceptilatio, and novatio (Dig.46.a.31. 1). Com·
pensatio, or set-off, extinguishes correal obligation only il it goes to the
whole debt, Dig. 20. 4. 4 : but if correal debt orA is sued he cannot set-
off money owed to correal debtor B, unless he and Bare partners, Dig.
45. 2. ro. So, too, il the creditor sued one os the debtors, or one oi
the creditors sued the debeor, the obligation was extinguished lor all by
the action's reaching the stage ol litis contestatio, Gaius iii. 180, Dig.
45. r. 116 3 ib. a. 23 ib. 16; 46. 1. 5. In respect os passive correal

obligation this was altered by Justinian¹s constitution in Cod. 8. 41. 28, ,

which enacted that the debt should not be extinguished by litis con·
testatio but 'only by satisfaction oi the creditor: for active correal
obligation theold rule seems to have continued, Dig. 45. a. a ; 46. r. 5;
46. a. 31. r. Further consequences ol the unity os the obligation are
that any act ol a correus debendi, by which its perlorrnance becomes
impossible or more difficult, prejudices the rest: ‘ex duobus reis eius·
dem Stichi promittendi lactis alterius lactum alteri quoque nocet’ Dig.
45. a. 18 : as also does the interruption of prescription by oue ol them
only.

But the subjective relation oi the correi to the obligation need not
