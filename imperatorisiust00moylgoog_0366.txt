DE SENATUS CONSULTO TERTULLIANO·

Lex duodecim tabularum ita stricto iure utebatur et prae·

ponebat masculorum progeniem et eos, qui per seminini sexus
necessitudinem sibi iunguntur, adeo expellebat, ut ne quidem
inter matrem et filium filiamve ultro citroque hereditatis
capiendae ius daret, nisi quod praetores ex proximitate
cognatorum eas personas ad successionem bonorum pos·
sessione unde cognati accommodata vocabant. Sed hael
iuris angustiae postea emendatae sunt. et primus quidem
divus Claudius matri ad solacium liberorum amisson1m le-
gitimam eorum detulit hereditatem. Postea autem senatus2
consulto Tertulliano, quod divi Hadriani temporibus sactum
est, plenissime de tristi successione matri, non etiarn aviae
deferenda cautum est: ut mater ingenua trium liberorum ius
habens, libertina quattuor ad bona filiorum filiarumve ad-

and was himself succeeded by M. Aurelius no. 161 (Zonaras 12. 1), so
that it is curious that it is not mentioned by Gaius, who (ii. 195) speaks oi
A. Pius as deceased. An extension, clearly, of tho lex Papia Poppaea,
which conferred rights on women with a certain number os children
(p. 2 54 supr, Tit 7.2 int.) ; it gavero ingenuae who had borne three, and
libertinae who had borne four children (§ 4 int), a statutory title to
succeed their own issue who died intestate in preference to the agnates ;

by whom they were themselves excluded appears from the next section.

§a The mother was excluded from the first by the children osa
deceased son, whether they ranked as liberi oras cognati (for which see
Tit. 1. 13 supr.), the latter by a rescript os A. Pius, Dig. 38. 17. 2. 9. Alter
the enactment of the SC. Orfitianum it was ruled by imperial constitu·
tions, as is remarked in the text, that she must give way also to the
children ol a deceased daughter, Cod. 6. 57.1.4; 6.55. 11. She was
