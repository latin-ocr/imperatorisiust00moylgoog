INTRODUCTION TO BOOK I. 79

rights ¹. ln other wordS, persona is aman regarded as invested with
legal rights, or as capable of acquiring them, so that our attention is
drawn away from the man to the rights, or to the capacity of having
thern in virtue of which he is a persona The aggregate of a man's
rights was called his status 3 and accordingly the old civilians defined
apersona as ‘homo cum statu suo consideratus! But what is it in
virtue of which a man has legal rights? In modern times it is usually
in virtue of his submissim, absolute or partial, to the sovereign ol
the country in which he happens to reside; aman is usually capable
of acquiring all the rights which are comprised under the private law
of a state within whose limits he is dorniciled. This view is essen-
tially modern, and hy realizing its strangeness to the Roman mind we
shall have advanced some way towards understanding the ius per·
sonarum. Το a man, as free, the Roman state conceded such rights
only as were based on the ius gentium 3 but the civis possessed far
more rights, even in the held of private law, than the free peregrinus;
and many of these he enjoyed not through being a civis but because
he wasa member of a definite Roman family. The rights or status
with which a man could be invested within the Roman state were
thus always resemble to either freedom, citizenship, or family connec-
tion; and this way of loolting at the matter became so habitual to the
Roman, that of status in general he has little to say3 he always con·
nects it with one of these three ‘momenta' and classities a man's
capacity of acquiring rights (or ‘ status ') according as he is merely free,
isacitizen, or belongs to the agnatic circle of this or that Roman
familia.

If then the ‘law of persons' is the law relating to human beings
considered as invested with or as capable of acquiring rights, it is clearly
much the same thing as the law relating to these three ‘status' of
libertas, civitas, and familia: itis ‘the treatment of men in respect of
their position in and in relation to the Roman state, because, accord·
ing to that position, their capacity of right, and their capacity of per·
forming legal acts, will differ ’Β But it is obvious that much that can
be said, in respect at any rate of one of these three topica, has no
relation to private law3 the latter has to point out distinctions between
persons only so far as they are of importance to itself, and the distinc-

tion between civis and peregrinus is mainly publici iuris. Nor again
