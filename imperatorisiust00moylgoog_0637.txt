611 EXCURSUS 11. ¹

PubliliaJ wherever else itwas still avallable 11 was pura, and its only

peculiar incident was that the debtor was caet in double damageif ἵ

he unsuccessfully denied bis liability (lis crescens).

The Romans themselves never doubted thatmnminiecdowmatm
legis actio, though it was 110 lesa a form 01 execution than pignon's
capio: the former was Personal, the latter was Real execution The
fact would seem to be, aa is remarked by Mr. Poste ¹, tbat manus iniectio
has two meanings. Sometimes it is a solemn 101 01 1011-10111011, vir.
where the plaintifl's right is incontestable, and the defendant submita
But at other times it is the first stage in a legis actio, via where the
defendant denies his liability, and resista tbe claim either in person
01 through a vindex: and it seems probable that it was 1111011

8111010-Ρ100010 only in this latter case. If thisbe tnre,tbe application y

of the term ‘legis actio' to pignoris capio alone remains anomaloua
So far as we know it, pignoris capio was purely extra-judicial: ifa
man had a claim which the law allowed 111111 10 enforce in this manner,

he had no need of assistance from the magistrate3 the praetor did not y

appear at any stage of the proceedings, which presented a picture of
aa pure self·redress as could be found before courts and magistrates
had corne into existence. Why then is it called an ‘actio' at alll
Arguing from 1110 analogy of manua iniectio, it would not be 1111110
conjecture that pignoris capio also has two meanings, and that it was
a legis actio only when the person distrained upon denied hia liability.
and pushed proceedings to a regular action. 11 is well lrnown that
in the English law 01 Distress thie is done by an action of Replerln
in which the distrainee is plaintiff and the distrainor defendant: but
the parallel 01 manus iniectio makes 11 probable that in Roman law
the rdles were reversed, and that if the distress was alleged 10 be
unlawful the distrainor was bound 10 come furward as plaintilf in an
action 10 justify his act, by forcing the other 10 redeem his pledge 11
a price double the amount 01 the original debt ¹.

Of the three other legis actiones it seems probable that the oldest
is the sacramentum. Gaius says 11 was ‘actio generalis‚’ i.e. the
proper remedy in all cases for which 110 011101 procedure had been
ordained by statute. Though he describes 1110 us as a real action,

³ This conjecture is supported hythe known facts 01 the publicanus. who was
allowed 1ο proceed by pignoris cepio even after the introduction of the tumulari
system: and Gaius' words (iv. 32) suggest that the publicanus sued the taxpayer
who was in arrears in order 1ο compel him to redeem the property seized at asum

in excess 01 that actually due. Cicero spealrs (in Verrem iii. 11. 27) 01 ‘publiea-
nus petitor ac pignerator!
