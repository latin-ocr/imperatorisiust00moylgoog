r. 17. a. 17). It had thus become extremely necessary that these

should be multiplied, and also, is possible, recast in a more convenient
form, which should enable such alterations to be made in the substan·
tive law as circumstances demanded, and also secure the incorporation
in the main work os the detached constitutions which had been pub-
lished since the code os Theodosius. Theodosius had himself con-
ceived the design ol combining the writings ol the authorized jun’sts
and the imperial legislation (which had now been long contrasted
under the terms ius and leges) in one comprehensive statute book;
but the idea ol combination had produced no results, and os that
emperor’s two great relorms the one related to ius, the otberto leges
only. When Justinian bad resolved on his great scheme ol giving a
new form to the Roman law, the enormous mass ol the material and
the convenience ol dividing the labour ol codification caused him to
prefer the retention os the two elementa of the ius scriptum in separa·
tion. He also hesitated whether to retain them in their existing shape‚
subject ol course to such alterations as were called for by the neces·
sity ol harmonising them ahter se, and with the law as at present
administered, or, while preserving their tenor and substance, to com·
pletely alter their literary lorm; he tells us that a regard lor the past,
and admiration sor the services which the jun'sts and his imperial pre-
decessors had rendered to jurisprudence, had decided him in favour
ol the former alternative.
The codification of the imperial legislation, as having been in part
Ἴ already executed, presented the least difficulty; its claim was also the
more pressing, because all imperial officers were required by law to
possess copies ol the existing codices. This task was accordingly
a--first taken in hand ln nn. 528 Justinian appointed a commission
lor the purpose ol ten persons, among them being Tribonian, who
played so important a part in the legislative work ol the next sew

years, and who not improbably suggested to his master his whole
scheme ol legal reform. The work with which they were entrusted
was to form a single code out of the codices Gregorianus, Hermoge-
nianus, and Tbeodosianus, and the constitutions issued since aaa. 439 ς
omitting all that was superfluous, reconciling such enactments as were
inconsistent with one another, and, where convenience required, com-
bining several into one (‘ colligentes vero in unam sanctionem, quae
in variis constitutionibus dispersa sunt, et sensum earum clariorem
efficientes '); finally, they were authorized to make any alterations in
individual constitutions which they should deem necessary (‘ adiicientes
quidem et detrahentes, immo et mutantes verba earum, ubi hoc rei
