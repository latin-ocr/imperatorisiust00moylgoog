tionis depositarum renim quis exactione defraudetur. Prae· 31
terea quasdam actiones arbitrariae id estex arbitrio iudicis
pendentes appellamus, in quibus nisi arbitrio iudicis is cum quo
'agitur actori satisfaciat, veluti rem restituat vel exhibeat vel
solvat vel ex noxali causa servum dedat, condemnari debeat.
sed istae actiones tam in remquam in personam inveniuntur.
in rem veluti Publiciana, Serviane de rebus coloni, quasi Ser·

vanaque certamina, curn res iam fuerit approbata, tunc ex altera parte,
quae iarn paene convicta est, opponi compensationem iam certo et
indubitato debito, et moratoriis ambagibus spem condemnationis excludi?
Though the expression ‘aperto iure’ in the text above might seem to
imply that the counter claim must have been proved and established in
an independent action, it seems better to understand this passage to
mean that the proof and aestimatio of the counter claim must not be
so intricate as to practically reverse the respective rdles of the parties,
and as it were to turn the defendant into a plaintifi'.

Great difficulty is occasioned by the expression ‘actiones ipso iure
minuant' in the text, and by the attribution even in juristic writings (eg.
Dig. 16. 2. 4; ib. ro. pr.; ib. 21) to compensatio of an operation ‘ipso
iure' The standing opposition, in modes by which obligations were in·
validated, between invalidation ipso iure and invalidation ope exceptionis
(p. 448 supr.) has led some commentatore to interpret these passages by
representing set-off as by it'self (or ‘sine facto hominis’) absolutely
extinguishing the plaintifi's claim, so far as it goes ; but if this were so,
such a tacit or automatic reduction of that claim would take place in all
cases where the defendant had a set-off, whether the latter wished it or
not; a hypothesis which is sufficiently disproved by Dig. 27. 4. r. 4
‘praeterea si tutelae iudicio quis convenietur, reputare potest id, quod in
rem pupilli impendit, sic erit arbitrii eius, utrum compensare, an petere
velit sumtus,' and Dig. 16. a. 7. r ‘si rationem compensationis iudex non
habuerit, salva manet petitio) 'ibe real meaning of the expression seems
to be that, though the defendant, if he wishes to set-off against the
plaintiff, must plead his claim, yet, immediately he has pleaded and
proved it, its operation relates baclr to the moment at which the two
claims first coexisted: ‘si constat, pecuniam invicem deberi, ipso iure
pro soluto compensationem haberi oportet ex eo tempore, ex quo ab
utraque debetur, utique quoad concurrentes quantitates, eiusque solius,
quod amplius apud alterum est, usurae debentur, si modo earum petitio
subsistit’ Cod. 4. 3¹· 43 hom that moment no interest can be claimed,
except on the balance, Cod. ib., Dig. 16. 2. rr ; and if the defendant for·
gets to set-off, he can recover what he has pald in excess by condictio
indebiti, Dig. ib. ro. r ; 12. 6. 30. So far in fact as the two debts coex-
tended, each was extinguisbed: ‘dedisse intellegendus est etiam is, qui
compensavit’ Dig. 49. 14. 46. 5.
