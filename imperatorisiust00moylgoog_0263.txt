ex qua postumus aut postuma sperabatur, abortum fecerit,
nihil impedimento est scriptis heredibus ad hereditatem ade-

the making of a will: postumi sui are those persons who come under the
immediate (Tit. 19. 2 inl.) power ol the testator after the execution of the
will, or would have done so, if he had not died first. Thus they com-
prise (1) postumi sui proper, the testator's own children, sons and
daughters, bom after the execution of the will, who become sui by the
mere fact of birth; (2) persons postumorum suorum loco, i. e. (a) those
adopted or adrogated, and children legitimated by the testator after

Postumi were ‘incertae personae’ (Tit. 20. 25 inf), and therefore by
the old law could be neither instituted heirs nor disinherited, Ulpian,
reg. 22. 4: consequently, if they were sui, the will necessarily became
void. It was only by very gradual steps that it became possible to in·
stitute or disinherit postumi sui. In the most pressing case, vir. where
a postumus suus was born after the testator's decease, so that he could
not mend matters by executing a fresh will—the civil law itself tolerably
. early permitted his institution or exheredation, Ulpian‚ reg. 22. 19.
Doubtless the rule was the same in respect ofa grandchild in utero
whose father was no longer in the testators power at the time of the
making of the will, though he had been when the child was conceived
