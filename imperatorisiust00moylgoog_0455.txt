440 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. ut.

9 Recte quoque mandatum contractum, si, dum adhuc in·
10 tegra res sit, revocatum fuerit, evanescit. Item si adhuc
integro mandato mors alterutrius interveniat, id est vel eius
qui mandaverit, vel eius qui mandatum susceperit, solvitur
mandatum. sed utilitatis causa receptum est, si mortuo eo,
qui tibi mandaverit, tu ignorans eum decessisse exsecutus
fueras mandatum, possete agere mandati actione: alioquin
iusta et probabilis ignorantia damnum tibi afferat. et huic
simile est, quod placuit, si debitores manumisso dispensatore
Titii per ignorantiam liberto solverint, liberari eos: cum alio·
quin stricta iuris ratione non possent liberari, quia alii solvis-

By the actio mandati contraria the agent could compel the principal
to indemnify him (with interest, Dig. 17. 1. to 9) for all reasonable ex·
penses incurred in the proper execution of his duties‚ ib. 3„ 2, as also
against all liabilities which he had undertaken on his behalf, ib. 28. 38:
cf. ib. 453 ‘si iudicio te sisti promisero nec exhibuero, et antequam
praestem mandati agere possum ut me liberes: vel si pro te reus pro-
mittendi factus sim! The mandator is also answerable for all culpa, and
must pay the honorarium, if any, which he has expressly or impliedly
promised, Dig. ib. 6. pr: cf. § 13 inf. But the ‚agent cannot judicially
enforce these duties if he has exceeded bis instructions, unless he is
ready himself to bear the loss thereby sustained, § 8 supr, Dig. ib. 3. 2, or
until he has performed, or at least is ready to perform, all that be has
undertaken. The liability of several joint mandators is solidary, Dig.
ib. 12. 73 ib. 59. 3.

§9. By ‘dum adhuc res integra sit’ is meant ‘before the agent has
done anything in the execution of his commission,’ πρὶν ἄρξῃ τῆς ἀγα·
pacior Theoph. When he had once taken action the mandate became
final, for the agent then had an interest in the perfonnance of the duties
engendered by the contract: ‘si mandassem tibi ut fundum emeres,
postea scripsissem, ne emeres, tu antequam scias me vetuisse emisses,
mandati tibi obligatus ero, ne damno adficiatur is qui suscipit man-
datum’ Dig. 17. 1.15.

510. What is meant by saying that mandatum is dissolved by the
death 01 either party is that the obligatory relation does not descend to
their 111111, so far as any acts performed after the decease are concemed;
rights and duties which have already come into existence under 11 are
not extinguished: ‘inter causas omittendi mandati etiam mors man·
datoris est: nam mandatum solvitur morte: si tamen per ignorantiam
impletum est, competere actionem utilitatis causa dicitur. lulianus
quoque scripsit mandatoris morte solvi mandatum, sed obligationem
aliquando durare’ Dlg. 17. 1. 26. pr. But a mandate is not extinguished
by the mandator’s death, if it was to do something only after that event
had occurred: ‘si servum ea lege tibi tradidero, ut eum post mortem

¹ meam manumitteres, consistit obligatio' Dig. ib. 12.
