CORREALITY AND SOLIDARITV. 477

another promisee, or to the same promisee by another promis'or
(e. g. adstipulatio and fideiussio): in bonae fidei conuacts correal
obligation could be produced by a pactum adiectum directed to this
purpose, Dig. 16. 3. 1. 445 45. a. 93 (a) from testament, by the
testator charging a legacy on one or other 01 his heirs in the alter·
native, Dig. 30. 8. 1; 3²· 25. To create an active correal obligation
by will the testator must state this as his intention explicitly. (3) The
obligation was also coneal in the cases 01 express or implied agency
pursued by the actiones adiectitiae qualitatis, de peculio, de in rem
verso, quod iussu, exercitoria and institoria (see note on Bk. iv. 7. pr.
ini). (4) In a banhing partnership the socii were liable eorrealiter on
all their business transactione, whether entered into by one or all 01
them, Dig. a. 14. 9. pr. 3 4. 8. 34. pr.; see on Bk. iii. 15. 9. (5) Joint
owners 01 a slave who committed a delict, or 01 an animal which did
- damage, were correal debtors in respect 01 the noxal action, Bk. iv.
81111.

It appears to he the better opinion that a paying correal debtor
· had not, as such, a ius regressus against the rest (Dig. 35. 2. 62 pr.;
cs. Tit. ao. 4 inl), unless he and they were partners, Dig. loc. cit, or
unless, and here only so iar as, they had been benefited by the debt
which he had discharged, Cod. 8. 40. a. Savigny contends (Obl
§523-25) that the ius regressus existed in all cases, on the ground
that a cor-real debtor, when sued, could always meet the plaintiff by

exceptio doli, unless the latter consented to transiet to him his rights .

01 action against the other correi debendi, and that, when such acessio
could be insisted upon, utiles actiones were in the later Roman law
always granted under the fiction that it had actually been made. But
that the so-called beneficium cedendamm actionum belonged to every
correal debtor as such who paid is iar from certain: nor is Savigny’s
other assumption correct, that in every case in which it did exista
fictitious cessio was recognised: 101 though a paying fideiussor could
insist on an actual cessio it is certain he had no regressus against
cosureties, Gaius iii. raa, Bk. iii. ao. 4 supr, Dig. 46. 1. 39, Cod 8.
41.11.

The beneficium divisionis, or right to be sued 101 only an aliquot
share 01 the debt, belonged to correi debendi only in particular
cases, and by special enactment: it was granted to fideiussore by the

epistola Hadriani, Blr. iii. ao. 4, and from these was extended to
mandators, Cod. 4. 18. 3: Justinian gave it to persons jointly liahle
on a constitutum, Cod. ib. The effect 01 Νον. 99 on this branchos
law is too much a matter ol dispute to admit 01 discussion.
