624 EXCURSUS X.

(praedes sacramenti) lrom both parties lor payment in tlte event ol
deleat The vager having thus been duly laid, the praetor pro
ceeded ‘vindicias dicere,' to award interim possession to one or other
ol the litigante, taking sureties (praedes litis et vindiciarum) lor the re·
storation ol the property in disputa, and its mesne profits, il theother
proved his title. A iudex was then appointed by agreement to try
the question at issue, namely, which was the winner ol the vage:
behind which the real matter in litigation-thc ownership ol the shve
—lay in the background. Beiore this judge the case was first laid
in a succinet narrative form (causae collectio), which was followedby
evidence and arguments in detail ¹.

Both the remaining legis actiones are in personam. Ol iudicis

But it seems to have been a sort of modification ol the sacramentum,
designed lor the settlement of unliquidated claims. The employmebl ,
ol sacramentum itseli was conditional upon the applicability os the
wager, and this clearly depended on precise knowledge oi the peut
niary value ol that which was claimed by the plaintili'. In other
words, sacramentum, as an action in personam, lay only on litenl
contracta, on such stipulatione as were lor a certum, and on delictsin
which the pecuniary penalty was lixed by law; and iudicis arbitrive
postulatio seems to have been the remedy on contracta iuris gentium

demands, not something ascertained, but that it shall be ascertained

The procedure in sacramentum after the praedes litis et vindiciarum bad M
talen is very obscure, owing to a lacuna in the MS. ol Gaius, iv. r 5. ,exordire
to Studemund's textual conjecture, a single judge was originally appointed οῦ tit

interval ol thirty days between the legis actio before the praetor end the ⁸PP⁰¹¹¹¹‘

a necessary interval ol thirty or any other number ol days at all. but to transiet de κ
