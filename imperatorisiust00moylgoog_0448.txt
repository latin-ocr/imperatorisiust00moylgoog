when total (the only case in which it extinguished societas) it did so only
by producing one of the two higher kinds os capitis deminutio, and so is
not a distinct mode of termination : ‘damnatione bona publicantur cum
aut vita adimitur aut civitas, aut servilis condicio irrogatur’ Dig. 48. 20. 1.
The ‘alius' who ‚succeeds ‘universally’ is the fiscus, Dig. 46. 1. 71. pr.

§ 8. For cessio bonorum see p. 377 supr. Societas could be dissolved,
besides the modes mentioned in the text, (1) by lapse of the time for
which it was originally formed, Dig. 17. 2. r. pr. ; ib. 65. 6. Where per-
sons had become partners lor a definite term neither could withdraw
during it except on a reasonable ground, Dig. ib. 14-16, in the absence
os which it was open to the other to treat the partnersbip as still sub-
sisting, ib. 65. 6; (2) By division, either voluntary and extrajudicial, or
eniorced through action by one oi the socii: ior the form of this see

diligentia, as is said in the text, was merely that qualem in suis rebus,
Exc. VI ini. ; the reason assigned sor this by Justinian being the same as
that which is given in the case of depositum in Tit. 14. 3 supr. Between
co-heirs, on the other hand, a higher case was required, ‘quoniam curn
coherede non contrahimus, sed incidimus in eum' Dig. 1o. aas. 16.
If, however, aiter undertaking the conduct oi any particular piece ot'
partnership business, he left it to a subordinate, he was unconditionally
answerable sor the letters shortcomings, Dig. 17. 2. 233 and of such
