326 EXCURSUS ΙΙῙ.

As to loss ol Possession through agents, it should be observed,
(r) That mere intention of the principal no longer to possess is
sufficient; Detention may remain, but one os the elementa of Pos-
session‚ animus, has ceased to exist. (a) On the other hand, if,
though the principal no longer has Detention, his representative has,
the Possession is not terminated: ‘siquis me vi deiecerit, niens non
deiecerit . . ..per eos retineo possessionem’ Dig. 4 3. 16. r. 45: noris
it lost· even by cessation oi therepresentative’s Detenti0n‚ unless De·
tention becomes physically impossible, or Possession is assumed by
some one else. (3) For the representative to convert his own De-
tentiou into Possession‚ there must be either traditio brevi manu·
(contrarius animus on the part ol the principali, or (Dig. μ. a.
3. ιθ) some contrectatio on the others part amounting to furtum.
(4) Misdealing by the agent (ie. conveyance or abandonment) does
not terminate the Possession unless another party directly assumes it
(5) Mere tennination ol the relation os principal and agent does
not, ln itsell, extinguish the Possession‚ Dig. 4¹· a. 38 3· ib. 25. r;
ib. 40. r.

A question which has been much discussed is why Possession‚ apart
from bona fides and title, came to be treated as a right, and protected
by legal remedies. To this Savigny answers, that the violation ol
Possession‚ being in itsell no wrong, can originally have been re·
dressed only because it went hand in hand with some violation oi an
actual right, and that lull justice could not have been done in the
matter ol this latter violation, unless· at the same time the Possession
were protected. All the possessory interdicts, he says, presuppose
some wronglul act. In cases of violent dispossession this is obvious ;
but even where there is no violence the idea is the same3 e. g. in the
application oi the interdict de precario there is the wrongful act ol
abusing another person's good nature: cl. Holland’s Jurisprudence,
p. ¹30· On the historical question, in what connection the necessity
of legal protection was first selt, Savigny adopts the theory ol Niebuhr,
that possessory interdicte were originally devised in order to guard
the interest os the individual citizen in the ager publicus, which the
State permitted him to occupy and enjoy, and were subsequently
extended to the Possession ol private property, moveable and im·
moveable. In support of this it is pointed out that possessio and
possidere are very uniformly used to technically denote this kind oi
occupatior, and that the interdicts recuperandae possessionis relate
only to im1n0veables; other arguments are derived from the known
facts os precarium and emphyteusis (savigny, Possession l 12²). A
