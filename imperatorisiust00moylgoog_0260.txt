sed id quod ante fecerit, quam interdictio ei bonorum fiat,
ratum est. Item mutus et surdus non semper facere testa-3
mentum possunt. utique autem de eo surdo loquimur, qui
' omnino non exaudit, non qui tarde exaudit: nam et mutus is
intellegitur, qui eloqui nihil potest, non qui tarde loquitur.
saepe autem etiam litterati et eruditi homines variis casibus et
audiendi et loquendi facultatem amittunt: unde nostra con-
stitutio etiam his subvenit, ut certis casibus et modis secundum
normam eius possint testari aliaque facere quae eis permissa
sunt. sed si quis post testamentum facturn valetudine aut
quolibet alio casu mutus aut surdus esse coeperit, ratum nihilo
minus eius remanet testamentum. Caecus autern non potest4
lacere testamentum nisi per observationem, quam lex'divi
Iustini patris mei introduxit. Eius, qui apud hostes est, testa· 5
mentum quod ibi iecit non valet, quamvis redierit: sed quod
dum in civitate suerat fecit, sive redierit, valet iure postliminii,
sive illic decesserit, valet ex lege Cornelia

ξ θ. Deaf or dumb persons had been altogether unable to make a will ·

per aes et libram, the former, ‘ quoniam verba familiae emptoris exaudire
non potest,' the latter, ‘quoniam verba nuncupationis loqui non potest'
Ulpian, reg. 20.13. By Cod, 6. 22. 10 Justinian removed the incapacity,
save from those who were deas and dumb from birth (except perhaps
soldiers‚ Tit. 11. 2 supr), but he required those who were dumb to write
their own wills throughout.

§4. The execution oi a blind man's will required the presence of a
norroy, or, ii one could not be procured, oi an additional witness, and
all eight had to sign and seal the testament‚ Cod. 6. 22. 8.

55. ibe will oi a civis who was taken captive by the enemy was
avoided by his capitis deminutio maxima unless rehabilitated by post-
liminium (note on Bk. 1.12. ssupr.); is he died apud hostes he must
needs die intestata This was remedied in a somewhat curious manner
by the lex Cornelia de salsis (nc. 80, Bk iv. 18. 7 ini), which imposed
penalties on those who sorged wills os prisoners who died in captivity,
i. e. who produced a iorged will which they pretended had been executed
by the deceased prior to his capture. From this it was inierred that,
had such a will been actually so executed, the law would not have treated
it as void ; it could not have stultified itself by penalising the forgery ot
an instrument which, ex hypothesi, could have no legal effect whatever
(fictio legis Corneliae) : ‘lege Cornelia testamenta eorum, qui in hostium
potestate decesserunt, perinde confirmantur ac si hi, qui ea fecissent,
in hostium potestatem non pervenissent’ Dig. 28. 1. 12. The principle
of the fiction was subsequently extended to all rights and dispositions
whatever, ‘in omnibus partibus iuris is, qui reversus non est ab hostibus,
quasi tunc decessisse videtur, cum captus esset} Dig. 49. 15. 18.·
