EXCURSUS II.

rtJRn IN RE ALlENA OTllER THAN SERVITUDES.

Sururtrrcrrrs is a real (Dig. 3ο. 86. 4) right ol praetorian origin to
a building or part oi one, either in perpetuity or sor a very extended
term, without any right to the soil upon which it stands: it is a ius
iu re aliena because ‘superficies solo cedit3’ the house is properly
owned by the owner oi the soil: ‘superficiarias aedes appellamus, quae
in conducto solo positae sunt, quarum proprietas et civili et naturali
iure eius est, cuius et solum' Dig.43. 18. a. The modes in which
it could arise are-(1) contract, whether it toolr the form oi gift, sale
(Dig. 43. 18. r. ι), hire (the annual rent being called solarium), or
permissive building upon land oi the state (Dig. 43. 8. a. 17), ora
private person3 (a) legacy3 (3) judicial decree. Whether it could be
acquired by usucapio is much disputed: see Dig. 6. a. η. 3 3 41. 3.
26. Superficies was alienable inter vivos or by will (Dig. 43. 18. 7. ᾧ
9), was heritable, and could be made the subject oia pledge or·
servitude, Dig. ib. r. 6 and 7, ib. 9. For the protection of his right
the superficiarius could bring in their ‘utilis' form all the actions
available to the dominus—rei vindicatio, negatoria, confessoria‚ and
Publiciana, Dig. ib. 1. r. 3. 6 ; Dig. 6. r. 73. r, and he had aspecial
interdict de superficie analogous in operation to uti possidetis. That
he technioelly ‘possessed' the building seems to bc proved by his
ability to bring directly the interdicts de vi and de precario, Dig. 43.
16. r. 5 ; 43. 26. a. pr. and 3.

Emphyteusis may be traced back to the agri vectigales, large tracts
oi graaing land in Italy belonging to the state or the smaller civitates
aud municipia, but held and enjoyed by private persons subject to the
payment ol' a perpetual rent (vectigal), or let out upon lease sor very
long terms ol years. The interest ol such occupiers received a ‘real'
character from the action ol the praetor, who protected their pos·
session (Dig. a. 8. 15. 1) by interdicts, aud by a utilis actio in reru
(actio vectigalis, Dig. 39. a. 15. 26) available even against the lessor
himself when non-paynrent ol rent was not alleged; ‘agri civitatum
