INTRODUCTION TO BOOK lV.

Tun first five Titles ol this Book relate to the two classes of Obliga·
tions which have not yet been treated, namely, those which arise srom
Delict and Quasi-delict. These, we are told, are all os one character:
that is to say, the existence of the obligation does not depend in difle-
rent cases on different ‘causae' in the sense in which, for instance,
Sale is binding so soon as the parties have agreed upon the price,
while Exchange produces no vinculum iuris until there has been per·

. formance on one side; but their ‘causa'is always the same, vina

wronglul act (res), upon the commission of which the obligation at
once starts into existence. Ol such wrongsul acts four have specific
names, and are called Delicts : Thett (lurtum), Robbery (rapina), Injury
to property (damnum), and wilful Injury to the person or reputation
(iniuria).

The precise differentia ol Delict, as compared with other forms os
legal wrong, and the reason why some ol these offences—notably Thest
Ἰ and Robbery-were ever treated by the Romans as civil wrongs at all,
are topics upon which something is said in the commentary below.
The textos the first Title deals with Thest. The definition ol this, as
the deliberately wrongful dealing with (moveable) property, is con-
trasted with our own English treatment of the offence by its width and

generality. It is Thell not merely to appropriate what one knows to .

belong to another, but to barely use a thing ol which one has under-
taken the custody or which one holds in pledge, to turn what bas been
lent one to a use which it is not believed the lender would have sanc·
tioned, or even to deprive another ol the possession of an object which
one has delivered to him as security lor money owed.

The Romans divide the offence into two orders, according aethe
delinquentis or is not detected in its commission; the penalty in the
first case being a mulct oi lour times, in the second one ol twice the

value ol the property stolen: besides this, the offender or his heire can
be compelled by an independent action to restore the property itsell
ot its value. Certain obsolete varieties of Tnest, punished under the
older law by penalties quantitatively dillering from these, are incident·
elly noticed3 the liability of instigators and accessories is accurately
