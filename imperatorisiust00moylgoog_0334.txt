IURA IN RE ALIENA OTHER THAN SERVITUDES. 319

favour ol many classes ol persons: e. g. os a wile, or other person
who gave a dos, over the property ol her husband, to secure its
retum, and of pupils over that ol their guardians. So too the land-
lord ola house had a tacit hypothec over things ‘invecta and illata,'
as security lor his rent: ‘eo iure utimur, ut quae in praedia urbana
inducta illata sunt, pignori esse credantur, quasi id tacite convenerit:
in rusticis praediis contra observatur’ Dig. ao. a. 4. pr. τ and the leesor ¹
ol agricultural land had the same implied right over the crops: ‘in
praediis rusticis fructus, qui ibi nascuntur, tacite intelleguntur pignori
esse domino fundi locati, etsi nominatim id non convenerit' Dig. ib.
7. pr. Lastly should be noticed the new power of pledging the same
property to several persons· in succession, though to do this without
notice to prior pledgees rendered the debtor liable to a charge ol
stellionatus, Dig. 13. 7. 37. 1. Hence, tou, questions ol collision and
priority among competing pledgeeS, which occupy so large a space
in modern Roman law: a subject, however, too wide to be touched
upon here.

One result ol the general use os hypotheca was the'extension of its
rules and remedies to pignus. In the tirne ol Ulpian the right ol sale ¹
had become an essential and inherent part-ol every pignus: ‘etsi non
convenerit de distrahendo pignore, hoc· tamen iure utimur, ut liceat
distrahere, si modo non convenit ne liceat. Ubi vero convenitne
distraheretur, creditor, si distraxerit, furti obligatur, nisi ei ter luerit
denuntiatum ut solvat, et cessaverit’ Dig. r 3. 7. 4. The remedies
again were the mine, whether the pledge was effected by pignus or
hypotheca: so that in Justinian's time (as he remarks, Bk. iv. 6. 7
inl), there was but one surviving point ol difference between them: il
possession ol the object pledged passed to the creditor, it was called
pignus, is not, hypotheca; cf. Dig. ao. 1. 5. 1· (Marcianus): ‘inter
pignus et hypothecam tantum nominis sonus differt! The enumera-
tion ol pignus among the iura in re aliena is thus accounted for:
it is a right in the property ol another, sensu Romano, only qua
hypotheca.

The modes in which the right was extinguished require a briei
notice. It ceased to exist with the destruction ol the object pledged,
Dig. ao. 6. 8. pr. :- it might be released, without allecting the debt
which it secured, and that either by legacy or agreement inter vivos,
Dig. ib. 4. r; ib. 9. 3: and under certain circumstances it could be
destroyed or affected by usucapio or limitation ol actions: see Dig.
41. 3. 44. 5; Cod. 7. 36. r·; 8. 30. 2. Bttt asageneral rule the
right ol pledge ceases to exist only along with the principal debt:
