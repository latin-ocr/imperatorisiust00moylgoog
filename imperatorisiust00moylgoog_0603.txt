leaving any successor, Dig. 164 1. 143 46. 3. 95. r, or has undergone
capitis deminutio maxima, Dig. 2. 8. 5. pr. ; and similarly the answer to
the question, whether a surety, when sued, can defend himself by plead·
ing that his principal has been in integrum restitutus, depends upon the
object ior which the creditor obtained the guaranty; e. g. il the principal
debtor is a minor, and the very object lor which the creditor took the
surety was to protect himself against his restitutio ‘propter minorem
aetatem,' the surety cannot plead the exceptio : ιεἰ, cum scirem minorem,
etei fidem non haberem, tu fideiusseris pro eo, non est aequum fideius-
sori subveniri’ Dig. 4. 4. 13 pr.

Α surety cannot be deprived ol any exceptio to which be has once
acquired a right by any unilateral act oi his principal: ‘sed verius est,
semel adquisitam fideiussori pacti exceptionem ulterius ei invito extor-
queri non posse' Dig. 2. 14 62.

An exceptio in rem is one which can be pleaded against any one who
can sue on a given ground ol action: an exceptio in personam is one
which can be advanced only against a determinate person or persons;
eg. the exceptio doli, and sometimes that based on a pactum de non
petendo, as where one ol two or more correi credendi promisee not to
sue the debtor.

oi anticipated wrong, or sor the punishment oi actual breaches of the
peace; these were matters to be dealt with hythe imperium oi the
magistrate (consul or praetor), who upon application made would issue
an injunction (interdictum) or order (decretum) disobedieuce to which,
unless justified, would be punished by imprisonment, fine, or other or·
dinary means at his disposal ior enlorcing compliance with his command.

The chiel purposes ior which such interdicta were issued were the
prevention and punishment oi offences against loca sacra and publica
(Dig. 43. t. 2, ib. 7-14), and the protection ol Possession as distinct from
Ownership: ‘in legitimis actionibus nemo ex iure Quiritium possessionem
suam vocare audet, sed ad interdictum venit, ut praetor his verbis utatur;
uti nunc possidetis, etc.³ Festus, s. v. Possessio. Thus some oi them sall
within the sphere of public, others within that oi private, law ; their chief

characteristic however in this period is, that they are a class oi remedies χ

standing altogether outside and apert from the ordinary method oi

redress by legis actio, the procedure oi which was inapplicable to them.
Under the formulary system interdicts still continued to be issued in
