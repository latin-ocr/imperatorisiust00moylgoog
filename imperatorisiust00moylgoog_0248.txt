lino] PER QUAS PERSONAS NOBIS ADQUIRITUR. 233

Hactenus tantisper admonuisse sufficiat, quemadmodum6
singulae res adquiruntur: nam legatorum ius, quo et ipso
singulae res vobis adquiruntur, item fideicommissorum, ubi
singulae res vobis relinquuntur,opportunius inferiori loco relere-
mus. videamus itaque nunc, quibus modis per universitatem
res vobis adquiruntur. sicui ergo heredes sacti sitis sive cuius
bonorum possessionem petieritis vel siquem adrogaveritis vel
si cuius bona libertatum conservandarum causa vobis addicta
fuerint, eius res omnes ad vos transeunt. ac prius de here-
ditatibus dispiciamus. quarum duplex condicio est: nam vel
ex testamento vel ab intestato ad vos pertinent. et prius est,
ut de his dispiciamus, quae vobis ex testamento obveniunt.

hear os his so acquiring even possession, theold maxim being ‘per ex·
traneam personam nihil adquiri potest! Such extraneae personae had
always been able to retain lor a man a possession which he had validly
got ior himself ε and it would seem that soon after the establishment os
the empire (Dig. 41. 2. 51) it was attempted by an extension of the
. principle to break down the old mle as to the original acquisition ol
possession, and thus to get over the necessity os a double traditio. Labeo
seems by implication (Dig. loc. cit.) to have favoured the proposed inno·
vation, which was also approved by Javolenus. Neratius, writing under
Trajan, says ‘per procuratorem possessionem adipisci uos r'amsere con·
venr't' Dig. 41. 3. 41: Gaius (ii. 95) refers to the controversy as still
unsettled: but Paulus (sent. rec. 5. 2. 2), Ulpian (Dig. 41. 1. 20. a), and
Modestinus (ib. 53), assert the new doctrine as though in their day it was
completely and universally recognised. Thus the constitution os Severus
(Cod 7. 32.r)a11uded to in the text did not make new law, but was merely
a statutory confirmation ol a principle already sufficiently established by
juristic consensus, as indeed its terms themselves allow. lts importance
was that, in respect of all objects in which ownership could betransferred
by mere traditio, even ownership could be acquired for one by an extranea
persona: ‘ea quae civiliter adquiruntur per eos, qui in potestate nostra
sunt, adquirimus, veluti stipulationem (mancipationem i) ; quod natural
iter adquiritur, sicuti est possessio, per quemlibet volentibus nobis
possidere adquirimus' Modestinus in Dig. 41. Δι. 53. When, as under
Justinian, traditio was the universal mode of transferring dominium in res
corporales, delivery of possession to one's agent, is the transferor was
owner, was delivery os ownership to oneself: is he was not, all that one
got was possession, which, however, usucapio could convert into owner·
ship : but usucapio did not begin to run until the acquisition of possession
by the agent was made known to the principal, Cod. 7. 32· 1.
§ik Justinian now proceeds to diseuss universal successions, or the
modes in which a man's entire proprietary relations—bis property and
bis rights and liabilities, so far as they are not purely personal—pass
