which they retained for centuries after the assembly which passed them
had ceased to be a gathering in which the older populus took no part
or interest.

Yet to have given Rome one new comitia was not sufficient for
Servius Tullius. It has been observed above, that the political changes
which resultcd from the new position of the plebs were produced in
and through changes of military organization. By the new tribal
constitution, the old relation between infantry and cavalry, according
to which the former had been but a subordinate appendage of the
latter, had been superseded NeverthelesS, the distinction of cavalry
and infantry still remained a distinction of caste 3 the patrician alone
could be an eques ; the plebeian, however rich he might be, was con-
demned to serve on foot. To reduce the prominence of the distinction
between plebs and populus, if not to sweep it away altogether, it
was necessary to disconnect the military organization from the old
constitution of curiae and gentes; to substitute for this principle a new
onc; to base the military system on a new idea. This new principle,
this new idea, were those of timocracy. The leading feature in
Servius’ second reform was his division of the whole people, which
could be called on for infantry service, into five classes, in which each

, man's position was determined by thc amount of his property. The

first compriscd all those whose property was valued at roo,ooo asses
and upwards; of the second, the qualification was 75,0oo asses; of
the third, 50,000 ; of the fourth, 25,0oo; of the fifth, ro‚ooo. Those
citizens whose means did not qualisy them even for this fifth grade,
belonged to subsidiary, but of course unimportant classes, lrnown as
accensi velati and proletarii. To this proprietary classification cor-
responded an arrangement of the fighting rnen in centurias or com-
panies of a hundred. Of cavalry there were eighteen centuries, six of
which were drawn from the old populus, 'in accordance with the plan
of Tarquinius Priscus, and twelve from the plebs. The first of Servius'
new classes furnished eighty-two centuries of heavily-armed infantry ;
the second, third, and fourth, twenty fighting centuries each, and also

’ a coupleof additional companies, consisting of buglcrs and musicians;

thirty centuries were contributed by the fifth class ; at each step down-
wards in the scale the armour became lighter, the equipment less com·
plcte. The full number of centuries seems to have been one hundred
and ninety-two.

It is, however, the political side of the centurial organisation which
is of most interest in the history of Roman law, though this was not

a working reality until after the expulsion of the kings. The principle ·
