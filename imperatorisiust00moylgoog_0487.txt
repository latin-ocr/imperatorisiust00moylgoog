JOINT AND SEVERAL LlABILITY. CORREALITY AND
SOLIDARITY.

Trrn simplest type ol obligation is that in which there is but a
single creditor and a single debtor. There may, however, possibly be
two or more creditors, or two or more debtors, in the same obligation.
Sometimes, it is tme, this plurality of parties is apparent only, and not
real: it is seen, ona closer scrutiny‚ that there are, in reality, a
number ol' separate obligations, each with its single creditor and its
single debtor‚ and each distinguishable irom each ol the rest: the
misapprehension arising from the lact that there is something which
connects the several obligations with one another. For instance, il
A, B, and C jointly promise 5l. to D, or il D promises 151. to A, B,
and C jointly, D can claim only 5l. from each ol the promisors singly,
or each of the promisees can recover only 5l. srom him. Or again,
if a debtor or creditor dies, leaving several joint heirs, they are en·
titled or bound, and can sue or be sued, only in the ratio ol their
shares in the inheritance. In all these cases there is no single obli·
gation with a plurality oi parties on either the creditor or the debtor
side: there is a number ol separate and distinct obligations, which, in
our minds, are connected together by the unity ol the mode in which
they originate.

A different lorm ol apparent unity ol obligation is that, where two
or more persons are entitled or bound in the sense that each may
claim, orbe called upon to perform, the whole ol what is due under
the obligation, that whole being demandable as many times as there
are creditors or debtors respectively. E. g. the law imposes a penalty
ol rol. on any one who steals pheasants' eggs. A, B, and C together
go and steal D’s pheasants’ eggs: D can recover the rol. penalty
lrom each of tbe three in succession, exactly as if he were the only
delinquent, or as il the thests were independent or disconnected.
Roman law supplies an illustration in Dig. 9. a. rna ‘exlege Aquilia
, quod alius praestitit alium non relevat, cum sit poena? So too il D
injures A, B, and C by the same act, they can each separately recover
lrom him the penalty fixed by law: the obligations are independent,
' though arising from one and the same source.

Eut a third case is conceivable. There may be one creditor entitled
