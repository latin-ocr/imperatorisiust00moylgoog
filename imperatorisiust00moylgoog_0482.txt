'debet’ Cod 8. πμ), and is not prejudiced if (before notioc) he
allows the creditor to set the claim off against a converse one of bis
own. opinions differ as to the necessity of express notice by the
assignee himself. Many writers add that successive and competing
assignees rank, as against the debtor‚ in tha order, not of the assign- .
ments, but of the notice ς but this iadenicd by others, and seems to
be unsupported by tertual authority.

(a) After notice the debtor is no longer entitled to treat the
assignor in any way as his creditor, and, if sued by him, is protected
by exceptio, Dig. 2. 14. 6.

(3) The right pasees to the assignes with all the defects and all the
advantages incident to it white vested in the original creditor. So
far as the former are concerned, this may be expressed by saying that -
the assigrrment takes place ‘subject to equities: Cod. 4. 39. 8, i.e.
the assignes can be met hythe same defences as might have been
urged against the original creditor at any moment before notice of
the assignment was received, except such as are purely personal (e. g.
the exceptio pacti de non petendo, it avallable only against the
releasor). Among the advantages incident to the chose in action
which pass with it are rights of security, both real and personal, and
unsatisfied claims to interest3 the assignes may deal with it as if be
himself bad been creditor ab initio; eg. he may assign it afresh,
release it, or use it as a setoff.

(4) In respect of certain assignments for valuable consideration,
there is an important enactment of Anastasius (lex Anastasiana, Cod.
4. 35. aa), to the effect that no purchaser of a chose in action should
be able to recover more from the debtor thart what he had pald him-
self, with ordinary interest, even though it was¹ alleged that tbe
transaction was in part a gift. So far as the actual debt exceeded the
purchase money, it was ipso facto cancelled.

- The Romans did not carry tbeir theory of assignment beyond the
actio utilis, for although it is true that the assignee's right to sue was
often, and perhaps usually, attested hy a cautio or bond of the debtor‚
transferred by the assignor for evidentiary purposes, yet this cautio
was no embodiment of the right after the fashion of negotiable in·
strumenta in modern law, which are exempt frorrt the mles relating to
notice and equitics As Mr. Poste remarks (Gaius p. 431), ‘the com-
plete transferability of obligations was unknown to jurisprudence
' until modern legislation gave validity to connects with an incerta
persona, i.e. with a person unescertained exceptas a member ofa
