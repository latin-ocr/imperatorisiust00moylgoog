rana na MANDATO. 439

bonos mores est, veluti si Titius de iurto aut damno faciendo
aut de iniuria facienda tibi mandet. licet enim poenam istius
lacti nomine praestiteris, non tamen ullam habes adversus
Titium actionem.

Is qui exsequitur mandatum non debet excedere fines8
mandati. ut ecce si quis usque ad centum aureos mandaverit
tibi, ut fundum emeres vel ut pro Titio sponderes‚ neque
pluris emere debes neque in ampliorem pecuniam fideiubere,
alioquin non habebis cum eo mandati actionem: adeo quidem,

' ut Sabino et Cassio placuerit, etiam si usque ad centum ⁴
aureos cum eo agere velis, inutiliter te acturum: diversae
scholae auctores recte te usque ad centum aureos acturum
existimant: quae sententia sane benignior est. quod si minoris
emeris, habebis scilicet curn eo actionem, quoniam qui mandat,
ut sibi centum aureorum lundus emeretur, is utique mandasse
intellegitur, ut minoris si posset emeretur.

18. Gaius seems to have been in two minds as to the rights 01 an
agent who went beyond the price at which he had been commissioned
to buy; in his Institutes he adopts the Sabinian view (iii 161), while in
his res quotidianae (Dig. 17. 1. 4) he says ‘sed Proculus recte eum usque
ad pretium statutum acturum existimat, quae sententia sane benignior
est.³

The principal duties 01 the agent are—to properly execute his com·
mission, Dig. 17. 1. 5. 1, or to give notice, if possible, when he is un·
avoidably prevented, ib. 27. 2; in its execution to display exacta dili·
gentis, Cod 4. 35. 133 to execute it himself in person, unless he has
express or implied authority to depute the business to an agent 01 his
own, in which case be is answerable sor all shortcomings 01 his subor-
dinate which he was or ought to have been aware 01 (culpa in eligendo), ·
Dig. ib. 8. 3 ; to give up all property which comes into bis hands in the
discharge 01 his duties, unless lost or destroyed through no fault 01 his
own, ib. 8. 7 and 10, along with sruits and interest, 11 to produce these
be its nature ; to restore, at the expiring 01 his commission, all that bas
been antrusted to him; to give 1011 accounts 01 his receipts and ex-
penditure to the mandator, and to allow the latter to exercise all rights
01 action which, while acting in bis behali, he has acquired against third
persons.

The principal's remedy against the agent lor the breach 01 any 01 these
duties was the actio mandati directa, condemnation in which entailed
infamia, bools iv. 16. 2 inl, though iu Cod. 4. 35. 21 tbis effect is said
to ensue only where the agent has been guilty 01 iraud: cl. Cic. pro
Rosc Am. 38 ‘mandati coustitutum est iudicium non minus turpe
quam furti?
