2 In primis igitur sciendum est opus esse, ut aliquis recto
iure testamento heres instituatur eiusque fidei committatur,
ut eam hereditatem alii restituat: alioquin inutile est testa-
mentum, in quo nemo heres instituitur cum igitur aliquis
scripserit. ‘Lucius Titius heres esto,’ poterit adicere:‘ rogo
te, Luci Titi, ut, cum primum possis hereditatem meam adire,

per provincias potestatibus demandavit! 1122 praetor fideicommissarius
is mentioned byGaius'' u. 278, Ulpian‚ reg. 25. 12, and often' m the Digest.

The following are perhaps the most characteristic of the many points
of difference which Gaius (ii. 269-289) mentions as existing between these
two kinds of bequest: -

(ι) Α legacy could not exist apart from a will, and had to be expressed
‘civilibus verbis:' a fideicommissum could be imposed on intestate heirs
as well as heirs under a will, and even when contained in a will might be
written in Greek, Ulpian‚ reg. 25. 9. Indeed‚ while no one could be
charged witha legacy except the testamentary heina fideicommissum
could be imposed on any one who took a benefit from the deceased upon
his death: and though certain forms were generally employed, a mere
gesture, if unmistakeable, was sufficient, Ulpian‚ reg. 25. 2 and 3.

(2) Α legacy created an aetionable obligation (quasi ex contractu)
between the heir and legatee: a fideicommissum gave rise only to a
moral obligation ι the deceased was said fidei committere, as opposed to
directo iure relinquere. Even when fideicommissa had become an
adsidua iurisdictio, they could not be sued upon by a regular action at
law, which was tried by a iudex, but (if he saw fit in the particular case
to enforce them) they were adjudicated upon by the praetor in person,
thus forming a branch of his extraordinaria cognitio : and it was not till
Justinian's own time (Tit. 2ο. 2 and 3 supr.) that in respect of remedy
they were placed upon precisely the same footing with legacies.

(3) To benefit by a fideicommissum the recipient need not have testa·
menti factio or any other kind of capacity (see Tit. 2ο. 24 supr.): thus
one could be given to peregrini, Latini Iuniani, women who by the lex
Voconia were disabled from succeeding to testators possessed of roo‚ooo
sesterces or upwards, incertae personae, coelibes, and orbi. The incapa-
city of peregrini to take legacies is mentioned by Gaius (ii. 285) as the
probable origin of fideicommissa of res singulae: that of women under
the lex Voconia seems to be connected with the first cases of fideicom-
missaria hereditas, Cic. de fin. 2. 17 and 18. but by the SC. Pegasianum
(ξ 5 inf, Gaius ii. 286) fideicommissa were subjected to the rules of the
leges lulia and Papia Poppaea respecting coelibes and orbi (pp. 254, 5
supr.),and peregrini and incertae personae were incapacitated by senatus
consulta of Hadrian, Gaius ii. 285. 287.

(4) The lex Falcidia had not included fideicommissa within its scope:
this was remedied by the SC. Pegasianum, 2 8 inf.
