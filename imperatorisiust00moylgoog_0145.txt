his power in adoption to some one else, was originally effected by a com·
plicated process consisting of three stages. The child was mancipated Ἴ
by the paterfamilias to the adopting party (in the case of a son this had
to be repeated three times, the first two mancipations being followed by
manumission at the hands of the alienee, Gaius i. 134), the object of this
being the extinction of the patria potestas ; he (or she) was then usually
remancipated to the father, and by him finally ceded in iure to the
adoptive parent Another mode, practised only in the case of a son,
was for the third mancipation to be made to some person different
from both the other patres (pater fiduciarius), by whom he was ceded in
iure to the pater adoptans. Adoption being thus a judicia] act was said
totale place ‘imperio magistratus! In the earlier periods the consent
of the child was unnecessary, but later this was altered, Dig. 1. 7. 5. For
this complicated system Justinian substituted a simple declaration of the
parties before ajudge, which was registered in the acta, requiring, how-
ever, also the presence of three other persons who by relationship or
otherwise had an interest in the matter, Cod 8. 48. 11. Until the
changes referred to in this section, the effect of adoption had been the
translation of the adopted child from the potestas and family of the one
parent to those of the other: to his old father he became a stranger,
hut acquired compensating rights of succession, etc, in his new family.
Justinian enacted that in future these consequences should ensue only
where the adoptive father was a natural ascendant of the child (adoptio
plena); if the adoptive father was an extraneus (adoptio minus plena),
the child remained in his old family, and subject to the same potestas as
before, but acquired a right of succeeding his adoptive father ab intestato,
Cod. 8. 48. 10.
