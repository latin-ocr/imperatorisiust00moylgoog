Tit. 19.] DE INUTILIBUS SYIPULATIONIBUS. 403

intellegit quid agit. Pupillus omne negotium recte gerit: ut9
tamen, sicubi tutoris auctoritas necessaria sit, adhibeatur tutor,
veluti si ipse obligetur: nam alium sibi obligare etiam sine
tutoris auctoritate potest. Sed quod diximus de pupillis, 10
utique de his verum est, qui iarn aliquem intellectum habent:
narn infans et qui infanti proximus estnon multum a furioso

distant, quia huius aetatis pupilli nullum intellectum habent: p
sed in proximis infanti propter utilitatem eorum benignior· '

iuris interpretatio facta est, ut idern iuris habeant, quod

pubertati proximi. sed qui in parentis potestate est impubes,

nec auctore quidem patre obligatur. Si impossibilis condicio ll

§ 10. Infantes are children under seven years of age: ‘si infanti, id
est minori septem annis' Cod. 6. 30. 18 pr, ‘prima aetas infantia est. . .
quae porrigitur in septem annis’ Isidor. orig. 11. 2. Pubertas was
fourteen in males, twelve in lemales, Bk. i. 22. pr. supr. ; but to the
question when an impubes ceased to be infanti proximus, and when be
began to be pubertati proximus, no clear answer is to be found in the
texts. Savigny rejects the view of those who would decide this by
dividing the seven (or five) years immediately succeeding infantia into
two equal portions on the ground that, on the clear meaning of the
terms, there must be an interval in every child's life when he is neither
infantiae nor pubertati proximus, and inclines to the opinion that children
would be infantiae proximi during the year next after they ceased to
be infantes, and pubertati proximi during that immediately preceding
pubertas.

lt would seem that originally a pupillus could perform uo legal act
without bis guardian's auctoritas The inconvenience which this entailed
under the old law, which would not permit its solemn dispositione, man·
cipatio, in iure cessio, stipulatio, etc. to be made by agents, led toa
relaxation of the rule so far as to allow an impubes who was pubertati
proximus to act for himself in all transactione whereby he could not be
pecuniarily prejudiced (Bk. i. 21. pr. and notes supr.) ; and eventually by
the ‘benignior iuris interpretatio'referred to in the text the same pn'·
vilege was extended to all pupilli after attaining their seventh year.
Consequently, any pupillus above that age could perform any and every
legal act with bis guardian’s auctoritas: without it he could only ‘me-
liorem suam condicionem facere,’ and so could be promisee, but not
promisor, in a stipulation: bilateral contracte which he entered into the
guardian could either ratify or repudiate, subject to what has been already
said on Bk i. 21. pr. For the liability of an impubes ou delict see on
Bk. iv. 1. 18 inf.
