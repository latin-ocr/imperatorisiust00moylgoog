the will oi a husband in whose manus she had been; (2) tutores fidu·

⁴ ciarii, in case or' a ireeborn woman's manumission e mancipio (Gaius

i. 115 a); (3) tutores cessicii ; (4) tutores Atiliani, appointed by the
magistrates. Testamentary guardians were as old as the XII Tables
(note on ξ 3 inf.); but in relation to women they resembled the four
kinds just specitied in possessing but the shadow of those powers olveto
and control which belonged to a tutor legitimus. The sanction of a
tutor who was not legitimus was required to validate the woman's dis-
positions, wherever that os a statutory guardian would have been neces·
sary: ‘tutoris auctoritas necessaria est mulieribus quidem in his rebus:
si lege aut legitimo iudicio agant: si se obligent, si civile negotium
gerant, si libertae suae permittant in contubernio alieni servi morari, si
rem mancipi alienent’ Ulpian, reg. ιι. 27; in 20. 15 he adds the execu-
tion οἱ a will. But in all these cases the sanction was merely formal:
‘pupillorum pupillarumque tutores et negotia gerunt, et auctoritatem
interponunt: mulierum autem tutores auctoritatem duntaxat inter·
ponunt* Ulpian, loc cit 25, and the auctoritas ol a non-statutory guar-
dian could be demanded by the woman as a matter os right: ‘loquimur
autem de his scilicet feminis quae non in legitima parentium aut patro-
norum tutela sunt, sed de his quae alterius generis tutores habent, qui
etiam inviti coguntur auctores fieri' Gaius ii. 120, ‘saepe etiam [tutor]
invitus auctor fieri a praetore cogitur' i. r9o

lt was in respect oi makinga will that the woman was most restricted,
the original rule being that no woman could do this who had not sub-
jected herself to capitis deminutio by coemption, followed by remanci-
pation and manumission, or, in other words, by a fictitious marriage,
Gaius i. ιι 5 a; she thus obtained a tutor fiduciarius, who authorized
the testament ‘dicis causa‚' ib. 190, though in all this business the in-
terests oi the patron or agnates were completely secured, ior without
their sanction at the first the coemption could not have taken place
at all.

The only independent women who were exempted by the older law from
perpetual guardianship were the vestal virgins, on whom this privilege had
been bestowed by the Xll Tables, Gaius i. 1455 butaiter thefall oi the Re-
public important changes were made, especially in respect ol testaments.
The lex Iulia and Papia Poppaea, mn. 9, released from guardianship
all women who had borne a certain number os children (ius liberorum),
and this boon must have benefited a very large proportion of married
women who were sui iuris. Not many years later a law οἱ Claudius en·
tirelyabolished the legitima tutela oiagnates over women,Gaius i.157, and
by a senatusconsult passed under Hadrian they were enabled to make
a will without the necessity osa coemption, though the auctoritas of the
guardian was not dispensed with. Thus, in the tirne os the classical
jurists, every woman who was sui iuris, and who was not a vestal virgin
or exempted under the lex Papia, must have a guardian: but his
