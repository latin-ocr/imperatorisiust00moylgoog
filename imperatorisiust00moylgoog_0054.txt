IUS HONORARIUM-T HE EMPIRE. 39

the peculiarities ol the civil law-formality, exclusiveness, rigidity; they
are liberal, equitable, fitted to endure through all time3 and these are
lmsed upon tbe ius gentium, or rather upon the natural sense of right,
the naturalis aequitas, in which the Romans recognised that law’s
internal and generative principle. Theius gentium and the ius hono-
rarium or praetorium (ior practical purposes the expressions are
nearly synonymous) thus require to be distinguished, and their relation
to one another ascertained. The distinction oi ius civile and ius
honorarium is based on the difference of the organs to whose activity
they respectively owed their existence; that ol ius civile and ius gen·
tium on differences oi nature and ol extension The two would have
corresponded exactly ii the whole ius gentium had been taken up into
the urban edict, aud the latter had contained no other law whatsoever;
butas a matter oi lact, though there is a very intimate relation between
them, rules could and did belong to the one without also belonging to
the other. Still, the most important portion oi the rules enunciated
in the edict can be traced to the ius gentium, which indeed was the
clement in it which gave it such an honourable prominence among the
sources oi the positive law of Rome. Hence the common opposition,
to which attention has been already drawn, between the ius praeto·
rium and the ius civile. Yet not unsrequently t'he former is rechoned
part oi the latter, or rather the edicta magistratuum are enumerated
among its sources (e. g. Cic. Top. 5), though it is iar more usual to
find them contrasted (as in Dig. 28. 1. 23 ‘testamentum utroque
iure valebit, tam civili quam praetorio '). The eontrast was in part a
material one, the civil law was ‘proprium civitatis nostrae,' whereas
the greater part oi the ius praetorium was derived lrom the ius gen-
tium, and therefore its validity extended itsell beyond the limits oi the
Roman state into all nations which were under the rule oi law. But
in part, as has been remarked above, it arose from the difference ol
the organa through which the civil and the praetorian law respectively
carne into existence. hrule oi the -ius praetorium had no validity
other than that which could be given it by the praetor by whom it
was issued ; it did not bind his successore or even his official col-
leagues; its force was sar less, both in duration and in universality,
than that of a lex enacted by the sovereign populus. Rights conferred
in the latter way were necessarily protected by the praetor at all times,
but they existed apart srom and independently of him; rights con-
ierred by the edict depended purely and simply on his good saith3
thus (Dig. 7. 4. r) ‘usus fructus iure constitutus' is opposed to ‘usus
iructus tuitione praetoris constitutus ς’ and it was through this lormally
