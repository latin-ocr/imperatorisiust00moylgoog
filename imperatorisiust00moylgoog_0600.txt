acquitted; the judge’s sententia (which modern writers call absolutio
ab instantia as contrasted with absolutio ab actione) was that at that
time he did not owe the plaintiff what had been demanded from him,
and the latter could renew his action when the obstacle was removed,
though he had to uait twice as long as would otherwise bave been
necessary, pay all the plaintih's costs hitherto incurred, aud in the
meanwhile could claim no interest on the debt. As appears from the
text (ante tempus pactionis vel obligationis) the procedure was the same
whether the obligation was originally ex die, or paymeut was postponed
subsequently by a ‘pactum de non petendo intra certum tempus! Among
dilatory pleas ‘quae ad tempus nocent' were in Gaius' time (iv. 122) the
exceptiones litis dividuae aud litis residuae.

511. Gaius exemplifies exceptiones ex persona dilatoriae (iv. 124) by
the plea that the plaintiti' was suing bya cognitor when the edict dis-
qualified him from being so represented, or had appointed as his cognitor
a person similarly disabled from acting in that capacity; he does not
mention the exceptio procuratoria‚ though infames were disabled from
both representing others and being themselves represented in that form,
fragm. Vat. 32²·3· For infamia generally see on Tit. 16. 2 inf. Jus-
tinian’s enactment iu the last lines of the paragraph seems merely to
have formally deprived defendauts of a right which they had practically
ceased to exercise, and not to have affected the disability of infames to
appoint or appear as procurators; the judge could still reject an agent
because either he could not act as such, or the true party could not be so
represented, but the defendant could not.

Women could not be procurators on the principle of the SC. Vel·
leiauum, that all interventio was avirile munus. By Cod, 2. 13. a 5 state
officials oi higher rank were ordered to conduct their suits by agents, lest
by appearing personally they should disturb the impartiality of the court.

As a general rule exceptions are not subject to prescripti0n‚ sor a
defendant cannot advance them when he will, but must wait till he is
sued: ‘cum actor quidem in sua potestate habeat, quando utatur suo
iure, is autem, cum quo agitur, nou habet potestatem quando con·
veniatur' Dig. 444 5. 6. When, however, a party can assert his right by
