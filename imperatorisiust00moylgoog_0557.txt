petitio. quamvis enim usque adhuc incertum erat, sive inter
bonae fidei iudicia connumeranda sit sive non, nostra tamen

(1)Where the action is stricti iuris, the judge is bound by the strict
and literal words of the disposition; where it is bonae fidei he may
go behind them to discover the real intention os the parties. Hence, in
the latter case, he may take cognisance of pacta adiecta, formless subsi-
diary conventione ol the parties, if substantially a part of the disposition
upon which the action is brought, Dig. 2. 14. 7. 5. ln stricti iuris
iudicia this was not possible under the older law, Dig. ib. 7, though later
some exceptione were recognized, Dig. 12. 1. 4ο, Cod 4. 32· 123 ib. 23.
So too in a bonae fidei action the judge may rule local or other usages to
be implied terms in a contract, Dig. 21. 1. 31. 203 3. ς. 7.

(2) A bonae lide action lies on grounds on which one stricti iuris would
not, e. g. dolus and metus: ie. a party who has been induced by fraud or
intimidation to make a disposition may impeach its validity by the
ordinary action thereon, if that action is of the former, but not if is os the
latter character.

(3) Where a defendant is liable sor ‘omnis causa,' the value ot' the
latter is in a bonae fidei action ascertained as from the date of mora3 in
one which is stricti iuris (except possibly where it is condictio incerti)
only from litis contestatio, Dig. 22. 1. 38. 7 and 8.

(4) Under the formulary procedure the judge who tried a stricti iun's
action could listen to no exceptio which had not been expressly set
forth in the formula ; in bonae fidei actions no desences which could be
included under the very comprehensive idea os dolus need be advanced
so early in the proceedings; see Excursus X inf. But under Justinian
the maxim ‘doli exceptio bonae fidei iudiciis inest’ (which occurs in Dig.
23. 3. 21: 30. 84. 5: 18. 5. 3) has no processual significance: the stage
at which such desences had to be advanced is determined by other con·
siderations‚ as is shown on Tit. ι 3. pr. inf.

(5) In stricti iuris actions iusiurandum or iuramentum in litem was, as
a rule, inadmissible, but was regularly applied in such actions bonae
lidei as demanded restitution or production of property is ine defendant
refused or through his own fault was unable to produce or restore.

(6) ln stricti iuris actions the damages were assessed (litis aestimatio)
as at the moment os litis contestatio: in bonae fidei actions at condem·
natio, Dig. 13. 6. 3. 2.

(7) ll a place was fixed for the performance ol a contract the remedy
upon which was stricti iuris, it could originally be brought at that place
only; a bonae fidei action under similar circumstances lay at any place
where the defendant was amenable to the jurisdiction; see on Bk. iii.
ις. 5 supr.

To justinian's list of bonae fidei actions must be added (for the older
law) the actio fiduciae (Gaius iv. 62); and the action on innominate
contracts generally, not merely on aestimatum and permutatio, was of
this character.
