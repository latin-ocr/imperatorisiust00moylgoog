DE TESTAMENTIS ORDINANDIS.

Testamentum ex eo appellatur, quod testatio mentis est.

Sed ut nihil antiquitatis penitus ignoretur, sciendum estl
olim quidem duo genera testamentorum in usu luisse, quorum
altero in pace et in otio utebantur, quod calatis comitiis
appellabatur, altero, curn in proelium exituri essent, quod
procinctum dicebatur. accessit deinde tertium genus testa-
mentorum, quod dicebatur per aes et libram, scilicet quia per

emancipationem, id est imaginariam quandam venditionem,
agebatur quinque testibus et libripende civibus Romanis
puberibus praesentibus et eo qui familiae emptor dicebatur.

by both Gaius and Justinian. Τ1ιο two modes ot' succession are mutually ,
exclusive. 11 a man made a will, all his property (unless he were a
soldier) must perforce go to the heir or heirs therein instituted, even
though expressly instituted to certain portions of it only: there was
nothing lest lor the rules otterestate succession to operate on, or to go to
the person or persons who would have succeeded him had he died in·
testate: ‘neque enim idem ex parte testatus et ex parte intestatus de·
cedere potest, nisi sit miles' Tit. 14. 5 inl. : cs. Cicero, de invent. 2. 21.

Two other technical terms require a brief explanation. In some cases
the law cast the inheritance upon a person or persons whether they
wished it or not, Tit. ¹9· 1 anda inf. : immediately upon a mans decease
they became heirs apso sacto, and could in no way at law disencumber
themselves os the legal rights and duties, taken in the aggregate, which
that character iaaposed upon them. But in other cases (Tit. 19. 51111.) no
one became heres immediately, though some one (or more) was entitled
to become so 11 be pleased : here, as soon as it was known who was the
person so entitled, the hereditas was said to be ‘delata' to him : delatio
is the right actually to become heir : ‘delata hereditas intellegitur, quam
quis possit adeundo consequi’ Dig.5o.16.151. 11, alter consideration,
be decides that the inheritance is worth taking, delatio is followedby
aditio (Tit. ¹9· 5 and 7 ini), actual acceptance ol the succession. F irst
comes the death ; then delatio ; and finally, alter a greater or less interval,
aditio. But, whether the law makes one heir nolens volens, or whether ,
one deliberately accepts the inheritance alter sully weighing its advan-
tages and disadvantages, one canam get rid oi the character oi heres,
with all its liabilities, when one has once been invested with it: ‘semel
heres, semper heres' How iar this principle, as well as the other already
cited supr. hom Tit. 14 5, had been modilied at the end oi Justinian’s
legislative work will appear from the following Tities.
