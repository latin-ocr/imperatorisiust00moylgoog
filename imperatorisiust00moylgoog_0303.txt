288 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Libit.

21 ex eo reliquas inferre. Tam autem corporales res quarn incor-

porales legari possunt. et ideo et quod defuncto debetur,
potest alicui legari, ut actiones suas heres legatario praestet,
nisi exegerit vivus testator pecuniam: nam hoc ‚casu legatum
extinguitur. sedet tale legatum valet: ‘damnas esto heres
22domum illius reficere’ vel ‘illum aere alieno liberare' Si
generaliter servus vel alia res legetur, electio legatarii est, nisi'
23 aliud testator dixerit. Optionis legatum, id est ubi testator ex
servis suis vel aliis rebus optare legatarium iusserat, habebat
in se condicionem, et ideo nisi ipse legatarius vivus optaverat,
ad heredem legatum non transmittebat. sed ex constitutione
nostra et hoc in meliorem statum reformatum est et data est

licentia etheredi legatarii optare, licet vivus legatarius hoc non
fecit. et diligentiore tractatu habito et hoc in nostra consti·

The words ‘et ex eo reliquas inserre’ at the end of the section are iu·
terpreted by Theophilus as part of the rescript, not ol the will t but it is
clear that they belong to the latter, the manumission being ex die, and
taking effect from the giving in of the slave's accounts with his master,
the adverse balance being made up out of his peculium, ‘et quod reli-
quum est . . . solvere debet’ Dig. 35. 1. 111.

§ 21. This is called legatum nominis, nomen being the technical term
sor what we call a chose in action. The legatee could sue the testator’s
debtor by actio utilis, Cod 6. 37. 18, and could also claim an express
assignment from the heres, Dig. 30. 44. 6. Is the debtor paid the heir,
the latter could be compelled to transfer the amount so received to the
legatee : if payment were made to the testator in his liletime, the legacy
became void unless the will clearly disclosed a contrary intention, Dig.
32. 11. 13, ib. 64

⁸ §22 Where a res non sungibilis (lor which see on Blc iii. 14 pr. ins.)
is bequeathed without further specification (e. g. a slave, a horse, a jeuel)
it is technically called a legatum generis. Unless there was evidence of
a contrary intention, such legacies were valid only (1) il the inheritance
actually comprised a thing or things os the genus bequeathed, Dig. 30t
71. pr., and (2) it the genus was sufficiently definite: thus the legacy of
an estate is void, that of a house is valid, Dig. 23. 3. 69. 4. Under the
older law it would seem that as a general rule the legatee had the choice
of the object il the bequest was per vindicationem, the heir is it was per
damnationem: but under Justinian, unless the testator directed other·
wise, the election always rested with the former, subject to the restriction
that he must not choose the best specimen os the genus. Is the choice
was given to the heir, he might not select the worst : if to a third person,
he might choose neither the best nor the worst, Dig. 30. 37. pr.

ξ 23. Justinian's enactment on this matter is in Cod- 6. 43. 3.
