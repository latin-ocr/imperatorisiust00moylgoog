the real signification of this division ol law into personae, res, and
actiones, is the supposition that it was a classitication of great an-
tiquity among the Romans themselves, a classiflcation which they
regarded as fundamental and not lightly to be departed from, arrd
’ by understanding which therefore we shall obtain a deeper insight
into their national legal habit, and comprehend more fully the lead-
ing distinctions of their system, and the interconneetion of its parts.
Such a supposition‚ however, is an error which it is important onoe
forali to diseard. Sir Henry Maine has pointed out¹ that there is
no reason to suppose that the Roman lawyers set any extraordinary
value on this classilioation. It was confined, he says, to their institu-
tional usatites, or primers of law, the educational manuale placed in
the hands of their beginners. We may add that Gaius' other well·
known work, the ‘res quotidianae,’ was composed on another plan,
and that the order followed in the Institutes ol Florentinus, who wrote
after Gaius, was also quite different. The Twelve Tables again, and
the Praetorian Edict as consolidated by Salvius, Julianus, have no
trace of the Gaian classification; the Gregorian and Hermogenian
codes were arranged upon a different principle; so was the code of
Theodosius II ; so arethe two larger works of Justinian himself. It
may even be the case, as Savigny has suggested, that that classilica·
tion was based on an individuali, accidental opinion of Gaius himself ;
upon any view, however, we cannot suppose that by the ordinary
Roman jurist the division was regarded as much more important than
other current contrasts which Savigny instances, such as those ol vl,
clam,'and precario, the three forms of domestic dependence, potestas,
manus, and mancipium, the three capitis deminutiones, and the three
classes of cives, Latini, and peregrini. ll there was any traditional
view among the Romans as to the true mode of classifying their legal
mles, Sir H. Maine has shown, in the paper referred to, that it was
probably the view which from the force of circumstances has prevailed
in nearly every indigenous system of law under primitive conditions,
and which assigna the first place in the code to judicatura and rules
of procedure, in the interstices of which the substantive law has in
early times the appearance of being gradually secreted. The material
law tends to become distributed into ‘heads of dispute’ in an order
which seems to depend on their relative importance when it was
finally determined‚ and in which, in more celebrated codes than one,
a prominent place is given, in particular, to deposits and thefts
