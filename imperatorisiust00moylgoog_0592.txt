DE EXCEPTIONIBUS.

Sequitur, ut de exceptionibus dispiciamus. comparatae sunt
autem exceptiones defendendorum eorum gratia, cum quibus

A topic treated by Gaius ln close connection with the Prescription ol
actions is their Pendency; the question of the duration ol actions which
have once been commenced by litis contestatio. All actions were for
this purpose divided in his time into two classes3 those ‘quae legitimo
iure consistunt‚’ and those ‘quae imperio continentur! The sormer are
all actions which were tried within the first milestone from Rome by a
single ludex who was a Roman citizen, and all the parties to which
were citizens also; they were required by the lex Iulia iudiciaria to be
adjudged within eighteeu months oi litis contestatio, though previously
they do not seem to have been lImitcd, Cic. pro Quinctio 13 (Ι et hoc est
quod vulgo dicitur, e lege Iulia litem anno et sex mensibus mori’ Gaius
iv. 104). The latter comprised all actious tried outside the first mile·
stone, and also those tried within it by more than one judge (eg. by
recuperatores) or in which the judge or any party was a peregrinus3
they rell to the ground unless judgment was delivered before the
magistrate who gave the formula vacated office: ‘tamdiu valent, quamdiu
is qui ea praecepit imperium habebit’ Gaius ib.105. Where the iudicium
was legitImum, in personam, and had an intentio ln ius concepta, no

subsequent action would lie on the same ground; in all other cases the ¹

plaintiff could sue agam, but could be repelled by exceptio rei iudicatae
or in iudicium deductae, ib. 106, 107. The twenty years' suit spoken ol
by Martial (7. 65) was probably prolonged to this inordinate length by a
series of appeals3 suits tried extra ordinem (not being iudicia) were oi
course not subject to these rules, nor apparently were actions tried in the
centumviral court: ‘iudicia centumviralia, quibus peragendis vix suffec-
tura litigatorum aetas videbatur' Suetonius, Vesp. 10. Ι

The rules of Pendency described by Gaius went out of use with the
formulary procedure. Constantine appears to have put it in the power
ola defendant to compel his plaintifi to bring the cause to judgment
within two years from its commencement (Cod. Theod 2. 15), thch was
extended to three by JustInian‚ who also introduced a summaty pro·
cedure enabling a party to put a stop to unreasonable delay on the part
os his opponent: ‘censemus omnes lites .. .. ., exceptis tantummodo
causis quae ad ius fiscale pertiuent, vel quae ad publicas respiciunt
functiones, non ultra triennii metas post litem contestatam esse protra-
hendas’ Cod. 3. 1. 13. ἰ. 11 both parties let an action drop after its
commencement, it could be resumed at any moment withIn forty years:
‘quod tempus, id est, quadraginta annorum spatium, ex eo numerari
decernimus, ex quo novissima processit cognitio, postquam utraque pars
cessavit¹ Cod. 7. 39. 9.
