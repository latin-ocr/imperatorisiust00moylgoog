82 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK I.

sensu stricto (Title 11), and (3) legitimation (Title ro, ξ 13). Corres·
ponding to these are described the modes in which patria potestas
may be dissolved, and a person alieni may become sui iuris (Title ra),
most ol which may be grouped together under the three kinds ol
capitis deminuti0, which is described in Title 16, rather out of its
proper place. The guidance and control which children require in
their tender years is naturally provided by the care ol the lather3 but
to meet the contingency os the latter's death while a child is still
impubes, and especially to protect his proprietary interests, the Roman
law established various forms ol guardianship, to which the reader is
introduced by a further distinction of persons sui iuris into those who
have a tutor or curator, and those who act entirely lor themselves
(Title13). The various forms ol guardianship are treated in the
succeeding titles, and the functions ol a guardian, together with the
limits ol their necessary exercise,are touched on in Title ar. Title aa
relates to the rnodes in which guardianship is tenninated, and Title 23
to curators, or persons appointed by the magistrate to manage the
property ol various classes ol persons-minors over the age ol puberty,
lunatics, interdicted prodigals‚ and others who, from some mental
or bodily infirmity, are incapable ol adequately attending to their

· own affairs. Title ²4 describes the circumstances under which

guardians and curators have to give security ior the due administration
of their office, the nature of such security, and the liability of magis·
trates who neglect to exact it when they appoint these functionaries.
Lastly, in Title 25, it is pointed out that the duties ol guardians and
curators are os a public nature, and cannot, as a general rule, be
declined by any one called upon to undertake them; certain grounds
ol excuse however vvere recognised by law, and these are enumerated
in detail.

The very exhaustive treatment which the status familiae, as con-
trasted with libertas and civitas, obtains in Gaius and the Institntes

ol Justinian has led Savigny to regard the ‘ius quod ad personas ·

pertinet' as merely family law, and to maintain that such was the
meaning which those writers themselves attributed to it. He examines
the view that the real subject ol their first book is status, though
not exactly in the sense in which we have understood the tenn3
that is to say, he distinguishes status into natural and civil; by the
latter he means the three great status to which alone we have given
our attenti0n; by the former he would express the dilierences which

exist among persons as subiects of rights and duties on account os ,

differences ol age, sex, health, etc. This, ol course, is aperversion
