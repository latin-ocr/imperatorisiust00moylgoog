Such joint connects will not, however, in themselves create active
solidary obligation, Dig. 16. 3. r. 36; ib. 14· pr· (4) In mandatum
qualificatum (Bk. iii. 26. 5) joint mandatora incur solidary liabilityil
the debtor is unable to pay'himself, Dig. 46. r. 52. r 3: so too with
constitutum debiti alieni (note on'Blr. iii. ao. 8). 15) Wbere one

Solidary obligation is terminated—i.e. all the solidary debtors
are released, and the right oi all the solidary creditore is extin-
guished- by simple satisfaction oi the sole creditor, or by satis·
fection ol one ol the creditors by the single debtor. This rney
occur (r) by performance, solutio, or (a) by set-oli extending to
the whole oi the debt. But acquittal of one solidary debtor in
an action brought on his obligation did not release the rest lrom
tbeirs: ‘plures eiusdem pecuniae mandatores, si unus iudicio eligatur,
absolutione quoque secuta non liberentur, sed ornnes liberantur pecunia
soluta' Dig. 46. r. 25. 3. Acceptilatio (Bln iii, ²9· r) was equally
imperative, lor it is neither payment nor equivalent to it: and novatio
(ib. § 3) extinguisbed solidary liability only so lar as the object ol the
new obligation was quantitatively equivalent to that of tbe old, Cod
a. 4. r. In short, the intervention ol any event, which ordinarily
destroys an obligation, between the creditor audone ol the joint
debtors, or between the debtor and one ol the joint creditore, does
not affect the liability oi the other debtors, or the right ol the other
creditorS, unless it is or amounts to performance.

But, though the ultimate liability ol each ol several solidary debtors
lorthe whole object ol the obligations is clear, each ordinarily enjoyed

the following rights: (α) except where be bad been guilty oi dolus, or
oi culpa in excess oi the rest, he could claim to be primarily sued ,
only lor an aliquot part os the debt: he could be called upon to pay 3

more only is the rest or some of thern were insolvent (beneficium
divisionis). (b) Is another or othem oi the debtors had been exces-
sively in fault, he could in sorne cases (e. g. cotutors, Dig. 26. 7. 3. r)
demand that he or they should be sued beiore him (beneficium ordinis
sive excussionis). (c) Where he had not been guilty of dolus (Dige
27. 3. r. 14) and paid the whole, he had a ius regressus against the

rest by which he oould recover their respective shares of what be had
pald. In (r) supr. this right oi course did not exist: ‘in pari delicto
potior est condicio defendentis! ,
