570 INS Τ JT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [bh. Ν.

legere: namque stipulatur quis, ut solveretur sibi quod
fuerit iudicatum. multo magis is, qui in rem actione cou-

veniebatur, satisdare cogebatur, si alieno nomine iudicium ³

accipiebat. ipse autem qui in rem agebat, si suo nomine
petebat, satisdare non cogebatur. procurator vero si in rem
agebat, satisdare iubebatur ratam rem dominum habiturum:
periculum enim erat, ne itemm dominus de eadem re expe-
riatur. tutores et curatores eodem modo quo et procuratores
satisdare debere verba edicti faciebant. sed aliquando his

legentibus satisdatio remittebatur. Haec ita erant, si in rem
agebatur. sin vero in personam, ab actoris quidem parte
eadem optinebant, quae diximus in actione qua in rem agibrr.
ab eius vero parte cum quo agitur si quidem alieno nomine
aliquis intervenerit, omnimodo satisdaret, quia nemo defensor
in aliena resine satisdatione idoneus esse creditur. quod si
proprio nomine aliquis iudicium accipiebat in personam, iudi-
catum solvi satisdare non cogebatur.

by stipulation not only by the principal party, but also by sureties on bis
behalf, tbeir liability and his being correal: ‘satisdare dicimur adversario
nostro cum pro eo quod a nobis penit ita cavemus, ut eum boc nomine
securum faciamus datis fideiussoribus' Dig. 2. 8. 1. In this specific
sense it is contrasted in f 2 inf witb nuda promissio and promissio cum
iureiurando, and in Dig. 5. r. 2. 6; 40. 5. 8. 1 with pignoribus datis
cavere.

ln real actions under the formulary system the satisdatio given by a
defendant had varied with the form of the action itself. lf this was formula
petitoria the name of the security was iudicatum solvi (for which see on
ξ 4 inf.); if it was per sponsionem, it was called pro praede litis et vindici·
arum, Gaius iv. 91. 94 a. lf tbe defendant was a procurator, be bad to
give satisdatio iudicatum solvi himself ; if a cognitor, this was done by
the principal, Gaius iv. ror. A cognitor who was plaintiffhad not, like
a procurator in the same position, to engage ‘ratam rem domiuum babi-
turum,’ because he was domini loco, Gaius iv. 97.

ξ 1. Το Justinian's statement that under the older system a defendant
in a personal action who appeared himself had not to give security iudi·
catum solvi there are some exceptione. He had to do so ‘propter genus
actionis' in the actiones iudicati and depensi ; when he was sued for
retaining a portion of the divorced wife’s dos and pleaded her immorality
(cum de moribus mulieris agetur) ; and probably in the iudicium fructua-
rium in a double interdict, Gaius iv. 169. ln other cases the defendant’s
own character or position justified tbe suspension of tbe ordinary rule,

ie. where he had been, was, or was suspected of being insolvent, Gaius
ιν. 102.
