502 INS TIT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lu. lv.

6 Furtum autem fit non solum, cum quis intercipiendi causa
rem alienam amovet, scd generaliter cum quis alienam rem
invito domino contractat. itaque sive creditor pignore sive is
apud quem res deposita est ea re utatur sive is qui rem
utendam accepit in alium usum eam transferat, quam cuius
gratia ei data est, lurtum committit. veluti si quis argentum
utendum acceperit quasi amicos ad cenam invitaturus et id

peregre secum tulerit, aut· si quis equum gestandi causa
commodatum sibi longius aliquo duxerit, quod veteres scrip-
7 serunt de e0, quiin aciem equum perduxisset. Placuit tamen
eos, qui rebus commodatis aliter uterentur, quarn utendas
acceperint, ita lurtum committere, si se intellegant id invito
domino lacere eumque si intellexisset non permissurum, ac si
permissurum credant, extra crimen videri: optima sane dis·
tinctione, quia lurtum sine affectu furandi non committitur.
aSed et si credat aliquis invito domino serem commodatam
sibi contrectare, domino autem volente id frat, dicitur furtum

had been capitalis, Gaius iii. 1893 if the sur was alree man, he was
flogged, and then addictus to the person he had wronged; if a slave, he
was flogged and hurled from the Tarpeian rock; and athies who resisted
arrest, or who stole by night, might be killed. The ‘asperitas’ of this
punishment led to the praetor’s substituting the pecuniary penalty
mentioned in the text in all cases, Gaius ib.; that lor lurtum nec mani-
festum was fixed from the outset hythe Twelve Tables. The reason why
the two offences were so differently treated was ‘because the legislator
wished, by the amplitude of the legal remedy offered, to induce the κ
aggrieved party not to take the law into his own hands and inflict
summary vengeance on the offender’ hlr. Poste on Gaius iii. 1795 cl.

ξθ. Intercipere means the appropriation of ownership, quod alienum
est, sibi habere : the illustratione given here sall under (6) p. 499 supr. For
¹a creditor to sell the pignus against the terrns ol his contract was no less
theft than using it, Dig. 47. 2. 73. The person ‘qui rem utendam
accepit’ is the commodatarius. ·

Μ. ln the corresponding passage os Gaius (iii. 197) lor ‘sine affectu
iurandi ’ we read ‘sine dolo malo! Sabinus (Gell. 11. 18), and perhaps also
Labeo, had held that a commodatarius should be held guilty ol thest in
this case, is the dominus would not as a lact have consented to his using
the res commodata in the particular way, ‘cunr id se invito domino
facere iudicare deberet! But without express knowledge that his per·
mission would not have been given there could be no dolus.
