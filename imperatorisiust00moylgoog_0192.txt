fluons to multiply instances from the law oi coutract and delict, lor
the objection that nearly the whole ol the law relating to remedial
rights, which as a matter ol fact is placed under the head of actions,
would on his hypothesis belong to the law ol res, is fatal by itsell.

A far truer explanation ol this branch ol the system is given by
Professor Holland (Jurisprudence p. 85), who, following Savigny
(System ξ 53), defines itas the department oi law which treats ol
such modificatione ol rights as result from varieties iu the objects
or io the acts with which they are concerned. ‘¹‘ Res '' (the Roman
lawyers tell us), are either ‘⁴ corporeal,'' things which cen be touched,
such as a sarm, a slave; or “ incorporeal,'' which cannot be touched,
consisting in right only, such as a right ol servitude, a right oi action,
a right arising out ol contract Now “corporet” things are obviously
what we have called the “objects” ol the right ; “incorporent'’ things
are the advantages which the person entitled can insist upon; in other
words, “ the acts or forbearances '’ to which he is entitled’ Though
this may be true in the abstract, it seems erroneous to credit Gaius,
to whom Justiniau owed his classitication, with s conscious juristic
anslysis of which there is no clear indication in his writings, and
whose importance, though familior to us, seems to bave first been
placed in clear light by the continental jurists from whom it was
derived by Austin.

The true point of contact between the various res seems in reality
to be the lact that whoever has a res is, actually or prospectively, so
much the better off. ll then we emhrsce everything by acquiring
which a man is materially better off-he it an estate ora five-pound
note, aius in re aliena oran inhesitsucea right ol action on scon·
tract ore delict-under the general notion of property, we shall find
in the ins quod ad res pertinet the law ol proprietary relations, which
is treated under the heads ol Ownership, real rights less than Owner·
ship, Possessiom lnheritance, other universal successione, Contracts
end Delicts. Ol ownership or dominium, as a right or aggregate ol
rights, we are told little in the abstract3 we have to guther its content
lrom isolated passages That it includes the rights of use and en·
joymeut is clear from the power ol the dominus to separate them
off from his dominium, and vest them in other persons as distinct and
independent iura in re aliena (Tit. 4. 1): from Tit. r. 12 we gether
that the owner has the exclurrbe right to the thing, and may lawlully
prohibit others from intersering with his own enjoyment ol it; the right
ol alienation interrivos is stated emphaticclly in Tit. 1. 40: that ol
testamentary disposition is attested by the phrase of the Twelve
