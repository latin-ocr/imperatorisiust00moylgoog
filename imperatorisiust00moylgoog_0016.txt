GENERAL' INTRODUCTION.

Tun purpose of this Introduction is to give as tull an account as is
practicable, in a work such as this edition oi the Institutes, of the
history ol Roman Law and Legislation. In order to allow the largest
possible amount os space to strictly legal topics, constitutional history
has been avoided, except so lar as it seemed that these could not
he adequately understood without occasionally touching upon it. It is
ol course impossible to write on the history of any legislation without
taking some notice of the persons or bodies by whom legislative sunc-
tions are or have been exercised ; but such digressione from purely legal
matters can fortunately be confined within tolerably narrow limite,
because the Roman system owed so large a part of its development
in point ol matter to the praetor, whose powers, so sar as they were
legislative, were exercised indirectly, and it may almost be said covertly,
and in point oi form to the jurias, whose constitutione] position,
despite their direct influence on law, was in reality quite unimportant.

So far as legislation goes, what will here be said is little more than
a commentam, written in historical sequence, on the seven sources of
law from which the Roman system is said (Ins't. i. a. 3) to be derived.
As regards the system itsels‚ apart lrom the agencies by which it was
directly developed‚ or viewed from within rather than srom without,
the principal topics which will be treated are the relation os public and
private law at Rome ; the influence of caste, or, more precisely, os the
patrician and plebeian elements respectively on the material character
os the system3 the ‘duplication of institutions’ which resulted srom
the coexistence of what we may perhaps call a purely national with
a cosmopolitan legislative organ; the gradual absorption by what was
cosmopolitan of what was purely national; and the development and
characteres the Roman scientific or philosophica] jurisprudenee.
