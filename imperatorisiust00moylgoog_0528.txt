. periculum effugere non potest. Ac ne is quidem hac lege3
tenetur, qui casu occidit, si modo culpa eius nulla invenitur:
nam alioquin non minus ex dolo quam ex culpa quisque hac
lege tenetur. Itaque si quis, dum iaculis ludit vel exercitatur,
transeuntem servum tuum traiecerit, distinguitur. nam si id
a milite·quidem in campo eoque, ubi solitum est exercitari,4
admissum est, nulla culpa eius intellegitur: si alius tale quid
admisit, culpae reus est. idem iuris est de milite, si is in
alio loco, quarn qui exercitandis militibus destinatus est, id
admisit. Item si putator ex arbore deiecto ramo servum-'5
tuum transeuntem occiderit, si prope viam publicam aut
vicinalem id sactum est neque praeclamavit, ut casus evitari

cl. the text of this section). (2) The act by which the damage is
occasioned must be one ior which the person charged is responsible;
it must be due at least to culpa on his part: ior this see the next
section.

§a Τ1ιε fact that dolus was not essential to constitute damnum
iniuria datum distinguishes it clearly from the three other delicts:
‘when culpa is once established, the amount oi the deiendant's liability
does not depend on its degree 3' ‘in lege Aquilia et levissima culpa
venit’ Dig. 9. 2. 44. pr., ‘culpam autem esse, quod, curn a diligente pro·
videri potuerit, non esse provisum' ib. 31: cf.§8inf. The idea is suf·
ficiently illustrated in the next five sections.

It is a much argued question whether very slight negligence in a party
to a legal relation in which he was answerable sor culpa lata only would
entitle the other party to sue him under the lex Aquilia; as where a
depositary by slight negligence causes destruction ol or damage to the
res deposita. The true answer depends on the correct appreciation ol a
rather tine distinction. Sorne acts are acquitted oi culpa, if there be
alcgal relation between the parties, which would otherwise be imputable;
eg. a delicate piece oi glass work is given to an artificer to repsit, and
breaks to pieces in his hands through no want of skill or caution on his
part. But is the act is one which is not excused by virtue of the legal
relation, the actio legis Aquiliae will lie, because the delinquent is ex-
empted from liability sor culpa levis only in respect oi the specilic duties
which that relation impqses on him, Dig. qo 12. ¹³· pr.; 47.4. 1. 2;
9255

§ 4. Where a man is killed by a javelin thrown by a soldier ‘in campo
eoque ubi solitum est exercitari’ the culpa is all his own, and ‘quod quis
ex culpa sua damnum sentit non intellegitur damnum sentire’ Dig. 50.
17. 203. Contributory negligence oi the person injured usually excluded
the action, Dig. 9. 2. 11. pr.; ib. 28. ι; 11). 52. 1: but this was not so ir
the damage was wiliul, even though there had been culpa lata on the
other side, Dig. ib. 13.
