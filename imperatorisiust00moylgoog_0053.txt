38 INTRODUCTION.

the effect which the Stolo philosophy had upon legal method. Scae-
· vola, the first great lawyer of the School, was also the first Roman
who wrote a systematic legal treatise; and it is to the habits of thought
which the profession acquired with its tenets that we should ascribe
not only the systematis classifrcation, the mapping out of the field of
private law, bequeathed tous by Gaius, but also the wealth of Roman
law in legal principles, and the admirable logie of their subordination
and interconneetion ¹.

lt was in some such way as this that the Romans came to recognise
in the ius naturale or ius gentium an universal law binding on them-
selves, and to say of it, as Cicero does (de Offic. iii. 17) ‘quod civile
non idem continuogentium, quod autem gentium, idern civile (ie.
civium) esse debet! Notwithstanding, however, the fact that the ius
gentium was constantly being absorbed into the system through the
edictos the praetor urbanus, the ius civile still retained its peculiari·
ties 3 the streams of the two did not intermingle, so that the eontrast
between civil and praetorian law from this time onward becomes em·
phasised. The result was very similar to that which ensued upon the
incorporation of the plebs in the Roman state, namely, a duplication
of institutions. Whether it be in the domain of the family, of property,
or of obligations, the legal institutions of Rome are henceforward
found to a large degree in duplicate, institutions of the ius gentium
existing side by side with institutions of thc ius civile. The thorough·
ness of thir is perhaps best attested by the prominence, in all depart-
ments of the code, of the opposition between ‘the natural' and ‘the
civil! Thus, the conditions of marriage depend upon either civilis or
naturalis ratio (Inst. i. ro pr.): there is a natural as distinet from a
civil relationship, and the history of the law of intestata succession is
merely the history of the substitution of the former title for the latter
by equity‚ as represented first by the praetor, and later by the imperial
legislation; there are both natural and civil modes of acquisition in
the two fields of ownership and obligation; there is natural as well as
civil possession, natural aa well as civil obligation.

ln many cases the rules of the edict differed in form only from those
of the civil law ς in substance they were the same. But the vast ma·
jority of them are distinct in kind as well asin form; they have none of
