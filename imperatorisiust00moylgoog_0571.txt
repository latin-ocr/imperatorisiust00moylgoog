namque si servus in peculiari merce sciente domino negotietur
etquid cum eo eius rei causa contractum erit, ita praetor ius

erit, id inter dominum, si quid ei debebitur, et ceteros cre·

sufficiency of quod iussu, which was inapplicable without a specific
authorization, or where the agent was an extranea persona. The appoint-
ment of filiifamilias or slaves, especially the latter, to manage some
branch of trade or business (for examples see Mr. Poste’s note ou Gaius iv.
71), or to command a merchant vessel was extremely common at Rome,
and unless the principal bad been liable on contracts made by such
agents within the scope of their commission, more particularly in the
case of slaves, business would have been much hampered: ‘cum inter·
dum ignari, cuius sint condicionis et quales, cum magistris propter
navigandi necessitatem contrahamus' Dig. 141. 1. pr. lt would seem
that both of these actions were originally designed to render only
masters and fathers liable‚ and were subsequently extended to cases
where the agent was an extranea persona ; Gaius iv. 71.

§a The actio tributoria could come into application only where
the slave (or filiusfamilias) who traded with a merx peculiaris sciente
domino (or patre) found himself embarrassed and unable to satisfy his
trade creditors in full ; here the latter could demand a distribution
among themselves of that portion of the peculium which had been em·
barked in the business in the ratio of their several claims. The division
was made by the dominus, who was treated as an ordinary creditor, and
therefore could not deduct debts owing to himself in full, though he had
the privilege of paying all his own claims pro rata, whether arising out of
the business or not, Dig. 14 4. 5. 6 and 75 the actio tributoria lay
againstthe dominus at the suit of any creditor who thought himself un·
fairly treated. If the slave had his peculium engaged in different
businesses, they were kept apart, the creditors iu each being entitled to
satisfaction only out os the capital embarked in that one upon which
these debts arose, Dig. ib. 5.15.16. Any creditor who got his debts
pald in full while the solvency of the affair was unsuspected had to bind
himself to refund in ease any others should present their claims: ‘nou
enirn haec actio, sicut de peculio, occupantis meliorem condicionem facit,
sed aequalem condicionem quandoque agentium' Dig. ib. 6.
