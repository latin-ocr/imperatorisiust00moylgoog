28 , . INTRODUCTION.

digenous law of Rome, as contrasted either with the whole ius gen-
tium, or with such part oi the latter as was taken up by the praetor
into his edict Its sources are enumerated in a passage already cited,
as ‘leges plebiscita, senatus consulta, decreta principum, auctoritas
prudentium! Only the first two of these are of practica! importance
until the establishment of the empire but all are explained below or
in the Commentary on Book Ι. Title 2. Cicero (Top. 5) adds to
these sources of the civil law three others, viz. res iudicatae, mos
(ci. Inst. i. a. 9), and aequitas. Usage, as a source oi positive law,
will be treated in the passage oi the Institutes referred to ². The
authority oi precedentS, expressly recognised by a rescript of Severus,
was established, as we may gather from Cicero, at a sar earlier period.
‘Nam imperator noster Severus rescripsit, consuetudinem aut rerum
perpetuo similiter iudicatarum auctoritatem vim legis obtinere de-
bere' (Callistratus in Dig. r. 3. 38). By res iudicatae in Roman law
are to be understood those mles os customary law which gained
acceptance by the uniformity of their judicial application to individual
cases, and which, according to Austin, are the only true customary
law whatsoever; among them the most important were the prae·
iudicia of the centumviral court. Their importance, however, as a
source oi law is so trifling that neither Gaius nor Justinian mentions
them 3 and this isone of the most interesting points of difference
between the English and the Roman system, which Sir Henry hlaine
explains by the difference in their early history: ‘The theoretical
descent ol Roman jurisprudence from a code, the theoretical ascrip-
tion ol English law to immemorial unwritten tradition, were the chief
reasons why the development oi their system differed from the de-
velopment of ours' By ‘aequitas' Cicero seems to have meant the
internal, living, intellectual principle which is an clement in all law,
and consequently not a distinet source from which a particular kind
of positive law is generated; his use of the' term is popular rather

expressions may bc noticed. (r)1n some passages ius civile signifies the older
civil law, whatever its specific source, as contrasted with later enactments which
either (a) partook oi the nature os ius gentium (thus in Gaiusii.197, 8, it is
opposed to the SC. Neronianum), or (b) were based on political rather than on
purely legal consideratione (thus in Gaius ii. 206, and Ulp. Reg. ²4· 12. 13. it is
opposed to the lex Papia Poppaea). (a) Itis sometimes opposed to the criminal
law (e. g. Cicero ln Verrem i. 42, pro Caecinae). (3) ln Dig. 1. a. a. 5 and ra
it is used to denote the law made by the Roman jnrists, ‘quod sine scripto in sola
prudentium interpretatione consistit! (4) lt sometimes expresses the ius Quiri-
tium as summed up in the Twelve Tables.
