Ceterum sciendum est aedilicio edicto prohiberi nos canem l
verrem aprum ursum leonem ibi habere, qua vulgo iter fit:
et si adversus ea lacrum erit et nocitum homini libero esse
dicetur, quod bonurn et aequum iudici videtur, tanti dominus
condemnetur, ceterarum rerum, quanti damnum datum sit,
dupli. praeter has autem aedilicias actiones et de pauperie

extended : ‘haec actio utilis competit, si non quadrupes sed aliud animal
pauperiem secit’ Dig. ib.4 ll the damage was done under provocarim,
the noxal action did not lie, but the person who was its indirect cause
was liable: ‘et generaliter haec actio locum habet, quotiens contra
naturam sera mota pauperiem dedit. Ideoque si equus dolore concitatus
calce petierit, cessare istam actionem, sed eum, qui equum percusserit
aut vulneraverit, in iactum . . . teneri : at si cum equum permulsisset quis
vel palpatus esset, 'calce eum percusserit, erit actioni locus ’ Dig. ib. 7.
Damage done by an animal which fell within the rule was treated exactly
like a delict committed by a slave: ‘et curn etiam in quadrupedibus noxa
caput sequitur, adversus dominum haec actio datur, non cuius fuerit
quadrupes, cum noceret, sed cuius nunc est. Plane si ante litem con·
testatam decesserit animal, extincta erit actio' Dig. ib. 12 and 13. So
too is the animal died naturally or by accident, the owner's liability was
extinguished, Dig. ib. 16.

The illustration of the bear might lead one to suppose that no noxal · ’

action lay where the animal which did the damage was serae naturae. But
this assumption is contradicted in the text below (§ 1 ‘praeter bas autem
aedilicias actiones et de pauperie locum habet'); and though many are
lor ‚rejecting this as bad law, it seems better to say thet the actio de
pauperie was availahle at any rate in the ease of an animal which, though
by birth serae naturae, no longer enjoyed its natural liberty, but was in
some degree tamed or domesticated, and so in doing iujury might be said
to be acting ‘against its nature.’

The only case in which the owner oi a domestic beast was liable sor
damage done secundum naturam suam was where grazing animals strayed
and pastured on anothers land (when an action lay under the Twelve
Tables), or fed on mast which seli pn their owners land from a neigh-
bour’s trees : ‘si glans ex arbore tua in meum fundum cadat, eamque ego
immisso pecore depascam, Aristo scribit, non sibi occurrere legitimam
actionem, qua experiri possis, nam neque exlege duodecim tabularum de
pastu pecoris, quia norr in tuo pascitur, neque de⁴ pauperie, neque damni ¹
iniuriae agi posse: in factum itaque erit agendum’ Dig. 19. 5. 14. 3.

ξ 1. The public roads were under the special charge oi the aediles, Dig.
43. ro. The penalty prescribed in the edict lor the death ol a ireeman
was 200 solidi ; ior injury other than death a sum which was left to the
discretiori ol the judge; forali other damage duplum. The action under
this edict seems to have been popularis.

Two or more actions are said tu concur when one and the same
