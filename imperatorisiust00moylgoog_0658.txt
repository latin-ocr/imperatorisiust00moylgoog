, The constant tendency ol the praetorto enlarge the sphere oi his
extraordinaria cognitio, aiter the establishment os the empire, at the
expense of the regular procedure by formula, paved the way to the
total abolition oi the latter. An even stronger influence, which was
perpetually working against the ordo iudiciorum privatorum, was the
new appellate jurisdiction3 for, as has been observed, formulae were
’ employed only in courts of lowest instance ¹. Eventually the sonuu-
lary procedure was abolished by Diocletian, nn. 294, magistrates
being compelled to hear and decide suits themselves through all their
stages; and even when, from stress ol business, they were obliged to
refer an occasional action to a iudex, their relation to the latter was
no longer that oi the older system; the proceedings were no longer
divided between ius and iudicium, but the whole os them were dele-
gated; magistratus and iudex, so sar as the administrationes justice
is concemed, are interchangeable terms. As is observed by Mr. Poste ²,
the libellary procedure in use in the time oi Justinian was essentially
the same as cognitio extraordinaria ³.

¹ A sure index oi the increasing activity of the extraordinarie cognitio is the
frequent use ot the expression ‘iudex pedaneus’ (χαμωθικαστὴς, Theophilus) by the
classical jurists. This originated in the practice oi calling the magistrate himself
‘iudex,' which was only natural when he took to personully hearing and decidlng
many actions; ‘iudex pedaneus' is the index instrueted by formula.
