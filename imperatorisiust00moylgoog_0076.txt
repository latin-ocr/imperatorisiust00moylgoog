THE EARLIER CODES AND COMPIL34TIONS. 61

to speak of the legislation of Justinian, is that of the codices con-
stitutionum, or compilatione of imperial ordinances‚ which spread them·
selues over about two aud a-bali centuries. The first with which we
are acquainted is the codex Gregorianus, a collection of constitutions
issued from the time, probably, oi Hadrian up to nn. 284, and prin·
cipally rescripte oi Septimius Severus and the emperors who succeeded
him. Its exact date is uncertain, but it cannot well be placed earlier
than nn. 2953 its arrangement was based upon that of the current
commentaries on the Edict. Another compilation ol the same
character is the codex Hennogenianus‚ which may be regarded as an
appendix to the loregoing. The oldest constitution which it con·
tained was issucd tun. 290 or 291 ς the great maJ'ority of thern belong
to Diocletian and Maximian (nn. 284-305)‚ though seven enacted
by Valens and Valentinian, about ab. 365, are also referred to it;
if this is correct, its composition must lie between tn. 365 and rb.
398, but there are civilians who place it many years besore the earlier
of these two dates, and accordingly deny that it could have corn-
prised constitutions oi Valens and Valentinian. Both ol these codices, ·
so far as we ltnow, were formed by private persons, that is to say,
not under the authority os an imperial commission3 they were in
constant use both in the West and in the East, and lost their im-
portanoe in the latter hali ol the empire only by being absorbed in
his own code by Justinian.

The contenta oi the so—called ‘Vatican fragments' are more mis·
cellaneous. They are portione of a compilation oi excerpts from
juristic writings and imperial rescripte and edicte, and were first
published in 1823. The author is unknown, but the date ol the work
must be between nu. 372 and run. 438, sor it contains a constitution
issued in the first oi these two years, and in the latter the Theodo-
sian code was published. The jun'sts whose worlrs are most largely
laid under contribution are Papinian (responsa and quaestiones), Ul·
pian (libri ad edictum, etc.) and Paulus (libri ad edictum, sententiae, '
responsa, quaestiones, etc.); Celsus, Julian, and Pomponius are also
oiten cited The worlr seems to have had a purely practical pur·
pose, and was arranged in Titles subdivided into rubrics. Seven of
the Tities are extant, relating to the following subjects: (τ) ex empto
et vendito; (2) de usufructu3 (3) de re uxoria et dotibus ; (4) de
excusatione; (5) quando donator intelligatur revocasse voluntatem3
(6) de donationibus ad legem Cinciam; (7) de cognitoribus et
procuratoribus.
