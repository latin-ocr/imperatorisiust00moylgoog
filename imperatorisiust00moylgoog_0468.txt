Tit. 29.] QUIBUS MODIS OBLIGATIO TOLLITUR. 453

condicio adiciatur, novationem fieri, sic intellegi oportet, ut
ita dicamus iactam novationem, si condicio extiterit: alioquin
si deiecerit, durat prior obligatio. Sed curn hoc quidem
inter veteres constabat tunc fieri novationem, cum novandi
animo in secundam obligationem itum luerat: per hoc autem
dubium erat, quando novandi animo, videretur hoc fieri et
quasdam de hoc praesumptiones alii in aliis casibus intro-
ducebant: ideo nostra processit constitutio, quae apertissime
definivit tunc solum fieri novationem, quotiens hoc ipsum
inter contrahentes expressum suerit, quod propter novationem
prioris obligationis convenerunt, alioquin manere et pristinam
obligationem et secundam ei accedere, ut maneat ex utraque
causa obligatio secundum nostrae constitutionis definitiones,

naturalem transfusio atque translatio, hoc est, cum ex praecedenti causa
ita nova constituatur, at prior perimatur’ Dig. 46. 2. 1. pr.; novation is
the extinction of one obligation by the substitution sor it oi another.
Originally it could talce place in two ways, transcriptis (Excursus Vlll
ini.) and stipulatio ; but in Justinian's time the latter was the only means
avallable ior the purpose. The end in view in a novation may be either
to change one of the parties to the subsisting obligation‚ or, without
changing the parties, to alter its nature either by converting a real or
consensual into a verbal obligation or by modilying its terms. 'ibe first
oi these ends is illustrated in the text by the words veluti si id. . . in
posteriorem the second, by the paragraph commencing sed si eadem
persona.. ..

The parties may be changed in two ways. Firstly, the creditor
may be changed, the amount and terrns oi the debt remaining the same.
Thus, is A owes Β 51., and C (with B's consent) stipulates from A for
payment of that debr to himself, A's debt to B is extinguished. The
same effect might be produced, though perhaps with a difference ol
remedy, without novation, by B’s assigning his rights against A to C,
Gaius ii. 38, 39, Excursus V ini. Secondly, the debtor might be changed,
the creditor remaining the same. Thus, ir under the circumstances
supposedB stipulated from C for payment to himself ol the 51. which A
owed him, A’s debt to B would be cancelled lt this was done with A’s
assent, it is usually called delegatio; irunt, ex promissio ; but see Poste's
Gaius, p. 670.

lt is immaterial whether the obligation which is novated be civilis or
merely naturalis: its extinction involves that ol all rights which were
accessory to it, such as guaranties, hypothecs, claims lor interest and
penalties‚ etc„ Dig. 46. 2. 153 ib. 183 ib. 27 ; ib. 29. So too, as is said
in the text, the obligation created by the novating contract willex-
tinguish the old one even though it be natural only, i. e. lor some reason
