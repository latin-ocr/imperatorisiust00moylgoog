THE EARLY COMITIA AND PLEBS. 5

sessed oi no civil rights whatever. Some sort of legal status it was
deemed requisita to give them, and this was done by placing thern in
immediate relation to some paterfamiliae, whereby he became their
patron, they his clienta But with the family os their patron they had no
connection3 their connection was with his gens ; they took the gentile
name, and became his ‘gentiles’ ln this way they were brought
within the protection ol the law, as dependents of a citizen 3 an object
which could not have been secured except by some such device, sor
the primitive Roman law recognised no claim to its support unless the
claimant could in some way show that he was within the pale os the
tribal constitution. But the clientes acquired uo political rights, though
the public duty ol military service was imposed upon them, and a con·
siderable force os infantry was thus added to the resources of the
slate.

This process however, of attaching all peregrini residing on Roman
soil to the populus by the tie ol clientela could not be prolonged
indefinitely. circumstances were gradually augmenting the number of
uon-citizens so largely as to necessitate some new mode os dealing
with these classes. The military temper and strong organization of
the Roman people resulted in a continuous addition of territory to the
domains ol the city ; little districts, principally ol Latin population,
were constantly being annexed, and their villages razed, the inhabitants
being encouraged to flock towards Rome, because thus they could be
most easily cowed into obedience and hindered from rebellion. These
immigrauts were at first settled on the stretch oi land, bordering the
three hills oi the populus, known from them as esquiliae3 as their
numbers swelled, king Ancus, who was allerwards honoured as the
founder os the plebs (¹ Romuli Ancique gentem ’ Catullus 34), assigned
tbem the Aventine as a dwelling-place. This was the population

which became the plebs, and which played so important a part in the ,

strictly legal, no less than in the constitutional‚ history oi Rome. The
question how to deal with them became daily a more pressing political
problem. To incorporate them into the existing tribe-economy was,
to Roman ideae, quite out ot' the question; the populus, being based
upon the gentes, was a kind os close corporation whose constitution
was limited by the definite number ol gentile aggregates. The plebs
theu must remain a body apart from the populus, and therefore its
members could have no political rights. But there seemed no reason
why the private should not be separated from the public elementa of
the law 3 and the result-whether it should be ascribed to ahappy
accident, or to the deepseated legal instincts of the Roman race-
