INTRODUCTION TO BOOK Is. 179

necessary qualifications ol the last, and the modes in which they
can accept the inheritance, follow in Title 19, which also containsa
reference to the vast revolution effected in the character of heres by
Justinian’s own introduction ol the ‘inventory’ Legacies are treated

at length in Titles ao and ar, and the successive limitatione placed
upon their amount in Title aa. The last three Titles are occupied
· with the subject os fideicommissa, trust successione and bequests,
the legislation relating to them, aud codicillis form oi disposition
resembling a will, but incapable of directly passing the deceased’s
universitas iuris, and employed sor the purpose os creating fidei·
commissa, or oi adding to or modifying a· previously executed
testament.

No small amount oi criticism has been passed upon the grouping
together in one department ol a legal system ol the topics which are
comprised under the ius quod ad res pertinet, and which, we may
truly say, would not be co-ordinated upon any other principle of
classification. The most solid objection is the inclusion oi the law
os Inheritance and that os obligations in the same division with that
os property and other real rights. The place of the first is due to its
character as one oi the modes of universal succession, among which
it ranks with adrogation, bonorum addictio libertatis causa, and (in
Gaius) conventio in manum, hereditatis in iure cessio, and venditio
bonorum. Through this false idea os proportion the importance ol
Testamentary and Intestate succession, as an independent branch oi
law, is altogether obscured·: moreover, as Savigny has remarked,
these modes ‘quibus res per universitatem adquiruntur’ are ex·
clusively regarded as titles to rights, whereas they arc equally sources
ol obligations. ¹ Accordingly, the German· jutius, in their systematic
treatises on Roman law, here abendon the Roman classification, and
maire Inheritance one oi their main divisione, instead os subordinating
it to that between titles to res singulae, and titles to universitates.

Why obligations are ‘res’ has been already pointed out. When an
obligatio is said to be a res, the active, or creditor's side ol the rela-
tion is intended. The promisee ina contract, unless the promise is
performed, and the plaintiff in an action on delict, have the power oi
recovering damages by action3 this partial control over another's
lrcedom of action is money’s worth, and falls under the category oi
property, in the wide sense in which the term has been used above.
An even more intimate point ol contact between the law os owner·
ship and the law of obligations may he sound in the ultimate purpose
oi the largest and most important class of the latter, viz. the creation
