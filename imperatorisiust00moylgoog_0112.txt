It appears then more probable that decreta and rescripta possessed
the force ol general law in relerence to later cases resembling those sor
whose decision they were originally issued, provided that the intention
oi their respective issuers had been that they should enounce a legal
mle, and not merely determine a specific case. Despite the evidence οι

ιιι 34), the question whether a particular rescript was intended by its
author to be merely personale (e. g. Blu ii. 19. 6 inl), or to state a prin-

ciple οι law, became a frequent subject ol juristic disputation. Such as ,

were undoubtedly oi the latter character were called generalia rescript'a
(e g. Dig. 35. 2. 89. 1 ‘divi Sevenrs et Antoninus generaliter rescrip-
serunt Bononio Maximo,' Dig. ιι. 4. 1.a ‘est etiam generalis epistola
divorum Marci et Commodi ’). But rescripts were also called ‘generalia'
when it was held that the rule which they contained might be extended
to cases even remotely resembling the one originally decided; e. g. the
mle ignorantia iuris non excusat is derived in its general torm by Papinian
from a rescript ol Severus and Antoninus, Dig. 22. 6. 9. 5.

From the time of Constantine onward, and in the Eastem Empire,a
particular kind ol rescripts acquired the name os ‘pragmatic sanctiens)
These are rescripta in answer ιο petitione, drawn up in a peculias and
solemn t'orm, and distinguished from other rescripta by being more
highly tased: Zeno restricted their use to petitions preferred by corpo- ,
ratious. ,

the emperor was assisted hya council, called in the later period con-

emperor iu the exercise olbis supreme appellate jurisdiction, and the
chamber in which such consultations were held was as early as M. Aurelius
called auditorium principis. lt was mainly in this way that the jurists
required their knowledge ol the imperial constitutions, ol which some of
them (e. g. Papirius Justus and Paulus) even made systematic collections.
