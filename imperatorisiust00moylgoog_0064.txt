THE CLASSICAL JURISTS-IUS RESPONDENDI. 49

opportunity displayed itself. Among the leading Sabinians may be
mentioned C. Cassius Longinus, who died under Vespasian, Caelius
- Sabinus, Javolenus Priscus¹ (206), Salvius Julianus (457), who has been
already mentioned as the compiler ol the Edictum perpetuum under
Hadrian, Sextus Pomponius (585),Sextus Caecilius Africanus(131),and
finally Gaius (535), author ol the Institutionum Commentarii quatuor,
the first book, so far as we know, bearing this title aud intended lor
elementary instruction, and also of Libri septem rerum quotidianarum
sive aureomm, and Commentaries on the Twelve Tables, the lex
Iulia aud Papia, and the urban, provincial, and aedilician Edicts.
Labeo's first two successore were M. Cocceius Nerva, mentioned in
Tacitus, Aura vi. 2.⁶‚ and Sempronius Proculus (37), aster whom this
school was called Proculian; his principal lollowers were Pegasus,
praelectus urbi under Vespasian, the younger Juventius Celsus (142),
and Neratius Priscus (64), whom Trajan is said to have preferred to
Hadrian as his successor in the empire. Alter him ou the one hand,
aud Gaius on the other, we have no further traces ol the controversy
between the schools. lt would seem that a reaction had set in,
probably because differences ol opinion which had once been genuine
had now been degraded to mere hair splitting, or because the jurists
on both sides had become possessed with the spirit ol Labeo, and
were beginning to revolt minet the abuse of authority3 at least we
may inser from Gaius (iii 98) that the pupils had taken to criticising
their masters Bocking (Institutionen § 17) isos opinion that the
disappearance of the schools is sufficiently accounted sor by the con·
dition ol law and legislation in the ageos the Antonines‚ and by the
establishment of public instruction in legal subjects‚ upon which more
wrll be said herealter. However this may be, the subsequent jurists
took each his own line, though only the most famous of thern need
be mentioned here. From Ulpius Marcellus, commender-inchiel in
Britain under Commodus, there are a hundred and fifty-nine excerpts
inthe Digest; Q. Cervidius Scaevola (307) was teacher ol Papinian and
ol the emperor Septimius Severus; besides these, Claudius Trypho-
ninus (79), Venuleius Saturninus (71), Callistratus (29), Aelius Marci-
anus (275), aud Florentinus (42), deserve notice. But the greatest
names are yet to come. Aemilius Papinianus was esteemed by all
his successors the greatest ol Roman jurists. He commenced under
Marcus Aurelius (n. n. 161-180) a political career which ended in his
