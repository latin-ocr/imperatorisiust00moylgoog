the establishment of the Empire, and before Hadrian, he was, like the
heres, enabled to sue ior the universitas by a ‘possessoria hereditatis
petitio ’ Dig. 5. 5. F or another view of the relation between the interdict
and hereditatis petitio see on Bk. iv. 15. 3 inf.

Α noticeable point oi differente between bonorum possessio and here·
ditas is that the former was never acquired ipso iure, as the latter was
by necessarii or sui et necessarii heredes. It was obtained originally by
application to the praetor (agnitio or petitio bonorum possessionis),
which could be made by an agent, while no one could accept an inherit·
ance except the person to whom it was delata, note on Bk. ii. ip 7 supr.
This application was usually granted without precise inquiry into the
applicant’s title, which, it investigated at all, was investigated later, and
only because it was disputed by some one who alleged that his own right
was a better one. In this case the latter would be granted a second and
· formal bonorum possessio ‘litis ordinandae gratia’ The sons os Con·
stantine enacted that honorum possessio might be obtained from any
¹judge or magistrate by a mere signification os acceptance‚ Cod. 6. p 8
and 9, though this, was still called agnitio or petitio l and this is the rule
referred to by Justinian in § 12 inf. as holding in his day. ’

The right to take the possession could be lost by either express re· ’
pudiation (i ιο ini.) or lapse os the time (specified in ξ 9 ; Ulpian, reg. 28.
to) within which it was required by law to be exercised. A person barred
by such lapse was excluded only from one rank or class: it he was
admitted by the edict in a lower rank also, he had another opportunity
t‘sibi ipse succedere ’ Dig. 38. 9. 1. 10 and 11). Occasionally, however, the
praetor would not grant honorum possessio without an examination into
the circumstances oi the particular case. For instance, the edictum
Carbonianum provided, that ii the parentage ol an impubes, upon which
his rights os succession depended, was disputed, the magistrate should
hold a summary inquiry, and ii in this his alleged parentage was not
clearly disproved, bonorum possessio should he granted provisionally to
him upon security being given against waste, until the question at issue
was definitely settled, such settlement often being postponed until the
child attained puberty. ln cases of this sort, is bonorum possessio was
eventually granted after the magisterial examinatior, it was called
bonorum possessio decretalis in contrast with that which was given
under the general provisions os the edict (edictalis).

Even supposing the bonorum possessor had an indeieasihle title as
such, the praetor did not necessarily guarantee him the succession

, against a possible heres, who might have remained satisfied with his

civil law title. E. g. a suus is praeteritus in the {ather-’s will, by which the
