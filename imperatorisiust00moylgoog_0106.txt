laedere, suurn cuique tribuere. Huius studii duae sunt4
positiones, publicum et privatum. publicum ius est, quod ad
statum rei Romanae spectat, privatum, quod ad singulorum
utilitatem pertinet. dicendum est igitur de iure privato, quod
est tripertitum: collectum est enirn ex naturalibus praeceptis
aut gentium aut civilibus.

may be, however, that Ulpian, from whom pr. and §§ r and 3 oi this
Title are taken, andin whose ‘Regulae,' Bk i, they stand in close con·
nection, meant ξ 3 to be an expansion or explanation ol pr. ; by enoune-
ing, as the first precept os the law, a rule relating to oneselt' and not to
other persons, he intended to say, that although justice is what he defines
it to be in pr, it is not yet enough to injure no one, and to give every
man his due, in order to save oneseli from collision with the law: the
law also punishes any unworthy conduct by which one’s own personality
is degraded.

§ 4. Public law ‘in sacris, in sacerdotibus, in magistratibus consistit'
Dig. 1. 1. 1. 2. ln the Roman view it comprised two parts: (1) constitu-
tional law in its widest sense, i.e. the law which determines in whom the
sovereign power shall reside, how it shall be exercised, and to what
checks the persons among whom it may be distributed shall be subject.
lt thus embraces all administrative law, which indeed under the later
Empire formed its largest portion ; see the account os Theodosius’ Code
in the General Introduction, p. 62, supr. Another important portion oi
it was the ius sacrum, even after Constantine had made Christianity the
national religion. (2) Crimina} law: privata delicta (torts) were distin-
guished from publica delicta or crimes: ‘publica crimina, quorum delatio
omnibus conceditur’ Cod. p 9. 30. pr, see Bk. iv. 18. 1. ins.

lt is os course impossible to draw a persectly hard and fast line be·
tween public and private law, and this was ior historical reasons par·
ticularly true of Rome (General Introd. p. 16 sq., supr.) ; manyinstitutions
are from one point of view regarded as publici, from another as privati
iuris; thus tutela, though discussed in the Institutas, was a munus pub-
licum, and so in Dig. 28. 1. 3, it is said ‘testamenti factio publici iuris
est' Civil procedure, from the prominente with which it is treated in
Bk. iv, and also by Gaius, was apparently considered a part ol private
law ; but by many this is regarded as arbitrary and unjustifiable, on the
ground that rules of procedure are properly rules determining how the
powers ol certain officers (magistrates and judges) shall be exercised.

The division oi the whole body ol law observed within the limits oi
any given state into public and private, though as old as Aristotle (Rhet.
i. ῃ 3), and adopted by the modern civilians no less than by the Roman
jurists, is severely criticised and reiected by Austin (Jurisprudence,
lect. 44), who would make the so·called public law part of the law of
persons. This is scientifically correct il we take law oi persons, as he
does, in a sense very different srorn that given to it by its originators:
