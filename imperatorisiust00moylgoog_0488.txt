JOJNT ANB SE VERAL LIABILITY. 473

by different obligations against two or more debtors, or one debtor
bound by different obligations to two or more creditors; but these
obligations, though different from one another, rnay have one and the
same object (act or forbearance): not ¹similar objecta, such as the
payment ol the rol. penalty above, but the same object3 so that
when that object is once attained by the performance osone osthe
obligations, all the rest, no longer having any object, cease ipso lacto
to exist. E. g. A, Β, and C jointly break my windows. Each is under
aseparate obligation to pay me lor mending them, and Ι may sue
which I plesse, apart irom the rest, ior the expensos to which I have
been put; but ii 1 recover the amount oi the glazier’s bill lrom A, I
can no longer get it lrom B or C, sor the claim is a civil one for com-
pensation, not a quasi-criminal one sor a penalty. In such a case,
there are as many separate obligations as there are debitores, hut the
object oi all these obligations is the same: each debtor is, therefore,
liable ior the whole object, or liable in solidum (as distinct stom the
liability pro parte exemplified by a joint promise to pay 15l.), but as
the object is only one, it can only be once attained, and therefore
performance by one oi the joint debtors releases the rest. This is
called solidary obligation: and as two or more debtors can be
solidarily bound to one creditor (passive solidarity), so two or more
creditors can be solidarily entitled against one debtor (active soli-
darity); ie. either or any one oi them can, without consulting the
other or rest, claim the whole object (which forms the connecting linlr
between the different obligations) from the single debtor 3 butas soon
as he has done what he has to do ior one, the vinculum iuris between
him and all is severed, and he is free. The predominance oi passive
over active solidary obligationis so great that some writers have
supposed the latter to have no real existence. There is a clear caseos
it, however, in Dig. 9. 4. 14. pr., though owing to its rareness we
need not concern ourselves with it here.

Cases of the passive form are (r) the joint commission ofa' delict:
the obligation oi the co·delinquents to make compensation (though
not to pay a penalty) is solidary, Dig. a. 10. r. 4. ; 4. a. 14. 15 ;
13. r. 1. (a) The liability of cotutors for dolus and culpa in the dis-
charge ol their fonctions, Dig. 16. 3. r. 433 ²⁶·7· 18. r 3 ²7· 3. 1. 13.
(3) Where two or more persons jointly incur a contractual but not
correal (ior which see below) liability (e. g. A and B jointly agree to
act as agents sor C, Dig. 17. 1. 60. a ; or as his depositarios, Dig. 16.
3. r. 43 ; or jointly borrow a thing ior use, Dig. 13. 6. 5. 15), they are
bound solidarily in respect os the duties witich arise from the contr-act.
