under the head of applied (as distinct from pure) family law. Secondly,
the relation of the law of inhen'tance or succession to the classification
so far suggested is by no means clear. If, however, we ask what is
comprised in the idea of an inheritance, the reply must be, the relations
of the deceased person in the departments of ownership and obliga-
tion, or, as the Romans significantly expressed it, his universitas
iuris; his successor takes his property, and has to pay his debts
The law of succession is thus a division of the law of property, but its
importance in all legal systems forbids our making it a merely subor-
dinate division. Rather, we should divide the latter into simultaneous
and successive property law3 the former comprising the law of things
and the law of obligations, the latter the law of inheritance.

The field of private law then comprises five great departments :—

i. Pure family law, including marriage, parental power, kinship, and
the relation of guardian and ward.

ii. Applied family law.

iii. The law of things, under its three main heads of ownership,
possession, and iura in re aliena.

¹ iv. The law of obligations.

v. The law of inheritance.

It must not be supposed that this is the classification of the Roman
lawyers 5 it is one which Savigny arrives at hyan a priori method‚
and, so far as we know, there was not one among the prudentes who
in his systematic writings arranged his subject-matter upon this prin-
ciple. The reason why the outlines of Savigny's system have been so

fully considered is, partly, to suggest to the reader an alternative

classification to that of the analytical school, partly to show how eom

plete the institutes of justinian, and their model the Commentaries of i

Gaius, are in their material if not in their formal treatment of private
law. Marriage, parental power, kinship‚ and guardianship are treated
with great fuhress in Book i. Applied family law forms no compact,
independent part of the work, but is found, to some extent, distributed
among the other departments. Thus, though dos is not explicitly
treated, donatio propter nuptias isdiseussed as one of the forms of
gift in Book ii. Title 7. The capacity of a filiusfamilias (a) to own
property independently of his pater is noticed in Book ii. Titles 9. rr,
and 125 (b)'to bind his pater by his contracta in Book iv. Title 7:
his position in respect of delict is the subject of Title 8 in the same
book; the relation of patron and ireedman, though only with reference
to the former's rights of succession to the latter, is treated in Book iii.
Title 7 ; the effect of adoption on the property and debts of the
