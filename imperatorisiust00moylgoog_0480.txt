THE GENERAL NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS. 465

tions only, which, if the inferior had a peculium, discharged thern·
selves by their operation on the latter, which was automatieally
diminished by what he owed the superior, and augmented by what
the superior owed him, Dig. 15. 1. 9. 2-4.·

In Bk. iii. 29 there is a discussion of the modes in which obliga·
tions could be extinguished: but this seems the most convenient ·
place for bricfly describing those in which they could be ‚trans-

= ferred. To this question there are two sides; either the right

Χ may be transferred, or the liability. Transference of the liability, if
¹ hy that we understand a transaction which entirely releases the
person who has hitherto been liable, and imposes the debt on some
one else, could (apart from universal succession) be effected only by
novatio (Blr. iii. 29. 3), which, when employed for this specific pur·
pose, was called expromissio, or by an act of a similar character,
defensio. Transference of the right also (except in cases of uni-
versal succession) could at first be effected only by novatio. This,
however, is not assignment, but substituted agreement; the assent
and cooperation of the debtor is required, and the right does n'ot
pass from the person entitled to some one else, but is cancelled on
condition of a new one being created in favour of the latter. The
Romans, in fact, struggled, with a tenacity equalled only by that of
the English Common Law, against the assignment of what we call
· choses in action, i. e. rights in personam; but while the reason
alleged for his resistance by the English judge was the evil of
” ‘maintenance‚' the Romans, with more lawyerlilre instinct, based
their opposition on the character of an obligation as an essentially

personat relation, the parties to which could not be changed without .

destroying its existence ¹.

A rude species of assignment became possible afier the introduc-
tion of the formulary procedure, under which plaintifis were generally
permitted to conduct their suits through agents (Gaius iv. 82). If
A, creditor against B, debitor, wished to assign his right to C, he
could make the latter his agent, procurator (in rem suam); C thereby
becanm entitled to accept performance from B, or in default to sue
him in A's name, the condemnation being expressed in his own
name (Gaius iv. 86, 87). The result, in the Roman view, was no
transference of the obligation, for Α remained the true and only
creditor ; all tlvat passed was the right of action, or rather the capacity
to exercise another's right of action, aud all that C asserted or
