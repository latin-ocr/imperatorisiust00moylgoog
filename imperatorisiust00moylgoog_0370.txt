DE SUCCESSIONE COGNATORUM.

Post suos heredes eosque, quos inter suos heredes praetor
et constitutiones vocant, et post legitimos (quo numero sunt
adgnati et hi, quos in locum adgnatorum tam supradicta
senatus consulta quam nostra erexit constitutio) proximos
cognatos praetor vocat. Qua parte naturalis cognatio spec-l
tatur. narn adgnati capite deminuti quique ex his progeniti
sunt ex lege duodecim tabularum inter legitimos non ha·
bentur, sed a praetore tertio ordine vocantur, exceptis solis
tantummodo fratre et sorore emancipatis, non etiam liberis
comm, quos lex Anastasiana curn iratribus integri iuris con· '
stitutis vocat quidem ad legitimam fratris hereditatem sive
sororis, non aequis tamen partibus, sed curn aliqua deminutione,
quam facile est ex ipsius constitutionis verbis colligere, aliis

ing to the mode of division. Il this was per capita, all the joint heirs
who took benefited equally by the refusal or inability oi those who did
not; is it was per stirpes, the accrual enured primarily to the benefit
only ol those who belonged to the same stirps with them that had sailed,
Dig. 37. 4. 12. pn, others gained only il there was no one lest ol that
stirps to take.

'rit V. Failing sui and the nearest agnate, the Twelve Tables had
given the inheritance to the gentiles os the deceased; ‘si adgnatus nec
escit, gentilis familiam nancitor! ln iii. 17 Gaius alludes to a definitiou
of gentiles in an earlier part ol his work, which, however, has been lost,
and the best account we have orthem is that of Cicero, Top. 6, cited by
Mr. Poste in his note on the passage oi Gaius referred to. Who they
were precisely is oi no practica] importance, lor Gaius observes that
even in his day the whole ol the law relating to tbe subject was obsolete‚
‘toturn gentilicium ius in desuetudinem abiisse.’ Tbere was in lact no
longer any civil law successor toan intestate in default os sui and
agnates; the gap was filled hythe praetor, who through the system oi

’ bonorum possessio substituted lor the gentiles a third order of claimants,
ranking aster liberi and legitimi, viz. the deceased coguates or next of
kin, in their several degrees oi proximity. Between two or more cog·
uates related in the same degree the division was always in capita.
