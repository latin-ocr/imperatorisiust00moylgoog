We have already touched upon the practical difficulties which arose
in the application of responsa and judstic writings to the judicial
decision of actions which came before the courts, and noticed the
usage which prevailed asto this matter in the earlier empire, and
which was directly confirmed bya rescript of Hadrian (p. 52 supr).
These difficulties had so increased with the growth of authoritative
legal literature that it became imperatively necessary to discover some
remedy. That which most immediately suggested itself was to lirnit
the authority which this literature in general enjoyed to a moderate
number of books, a plan which had already in its favour the rough

scheme of precedence which general practice had established among
the works of the classical jurists. Certain bools bad acquired a prc-
scriptivc authority in the various schools of law, public and private,
which were located in various parts of the empire. A student com·
menced with the Institutes of Gaius, which were followed hythe
Commentaries on the Edict, especially those of Ulpian and Paulus,
and the lattcrs responsa, quaestiones, and receptae sententiae: the
course closed with Papinian and Modestinus. The writings of these
five jurists had thus obtained a preponderance which naturally ex-
tendcd itself from the schools to the tribunals. Yet among them
there were a great many controversiea, and in this epoch neither thc
emperor nor the parties to an action were likely to be satisfied with the
rule which Gaius (i. 7) states on the authority of Hadrian, that where
jurists of different vicws were cited the judge might adopt whichever of
the conflicting views he pleased. ln order to obviate these difficulties,
Constantine had (an. 321) deprived of all validity the notes of Ulpian
and Paulus on Papinian, in which they had often found occasion
to controvert his opinions. Α more complete remedy was provided
by the so·called ‘law of Citations,' issued nn. 426 by the emperors
Theodosius Il and Valentinian 111. By this it was enacted that when
conflicting opinions were cited in a court of justice from juristic
writings with statutory authority, that opinion should be adopted by
the judge in whose favour most jurists were brought forward; if the
numbers were equal, the view of Papinian should prevail; if, in case
of equality, no definite opinion on the case in hand could be ex·
tracted from this jurist, the judge might select from the conflicting
views at his own discretiori. lt thus became the business of the
parties to relieve the judge of the labour of collating the ‘iuris
auctores' The procedure is compared by Rudorif to that of the
