Tit. a] VI BONORUM RAPTORUM. 509

sive comprehendatur raptor in ipso delicto sive non. ridi·
· culum est enim levioris esse condicionis eum quivi rapit,

47. 8. 1 ; ib. 2. 26. Cicero tells us (pro Tullio 8) that it was constituted
an independent delict by Lucullus when praetor in tte 77, by reason of

the frequency of crimes of violence which ensued upon the social war. ¹

The terms of the edict are preserved: ‘si cui dolo malo hominibus
coactis damni quid factum esse dicetur, sive cuius bona rapta esse
dicentur, . . . iudicium dabo’ Dig. 47. 8. 2. pr. It thus introduced a new
penalty for two classes of cases, those of damage to property, and those
of robbery‚ ‘hominibus coactis,' words which apply to both offences, Dig.
iba. 3 andra. The original edict seems to have run ‘hominibus antiatis
coactisque ;' but the carrying of arms for the purposes of crime became
so rare under the empire that the word was omitted and the definition
of the offence thereby extended. Before long too the words ‘hominibus
coactis' were taken pro non scriptis: ‘hoc enim quod ait, hominibus
coactis, sic accipere debemus, ett'am hominibus coactis ε ut sive solus vim
fecerit, sive etiam hominibus coactis, vel armatis, vel inermibus, hoc
edicto teneatur’ (Dig. 47'. 8. 2. 7 with Heise’s emendation). Lastly, the
bearing of the edict of Lucullus on wilful damage to property was lost
from sight, its practical importance being in the Corpus iuris confined to
rapina, which indeed seems to have been the case as early as the time of
Ulpian: ‘hae actio vulgo tibi (vi ?) bonorum raptorum dicitur' Dig. 47. 8.
217.

Tm fact that every case of robbery was also a furtum makes it improb-
able that the actio bonorum vi raptorum was ever employed except
within a year from the commission of the offence, and that only when the
offence itself did not come within the definition of furtum manifestum.
The penalty for which it lay being less than that recoverable by actio
furti manifesti (via three times the value of the property), it is clear that
if the raptor was detected ‘antequam eo pervenerit quo perferre ac
deponere rem destinasset' (Tit. r. 3 supr), the plaintiff would prefer the
latter remedy, which had the further advantage of not being barred by
the lapse of a year from the commission of the ofl'ence (see references
inf.) ; and after the lapse of a year the plaintitl could still bring an actio
furti, which, even if the offence were nec manifestum, would enable him
to recover a substantial penalty, while by the actio bonorum vi raptorum
he could get no penalty at all

ln Gaius' time some had thought that the quadruplum recoverable by
the actio bonorum vi raptorum was all penalty, and that a vindicatio or
condictio lay in addition, as in the case of furtum, Gaius iv. 8. The un·
certainty was due to the omission of the edict to say anything precise
about the matter3 and as the actiones furti and damni iniuria (which
were relied on as precedents) were one of them purely penal and the
other mixed (Gaius iv. 9, Tit. (a 19 inf.) it was natural that opinions
should differ. “
