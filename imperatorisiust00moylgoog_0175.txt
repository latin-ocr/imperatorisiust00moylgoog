iraudulently overreached minors to a iudicium publicum entailing a
pecuniary mulct and infamia on conviction. In the face of such a pro·
secution lew people would be likely to give credit to minora or even to
have any dealings with them whatsoever (Plautus, Pseudolus 1. 3. 9,
Rudens 5. 4. 24) z hence the rule was established (it is uncertain whether
by the praetor or by the statute itself : Capitolinus Marc. 10 is in favour
of the latter view) that minors who wished to contract or deal with others
should be compellable to receive a curator on their application‚ by whose
assent to the transaction the penal consequences oi the lex Plaetoria
would he avoided M. Aurelius ordained that any minor, apart from
such special occasion, should be ableto obtain from the praetor a getre-
ral curator to undertake the general administration os his property. A
lirrther protection afforded to minors against the consequences oi their
own inexperience or indiscretion was the praetorian practice oi in in-
tegrum restitutio, lor which see on Blc iv. 6. 33 inl.

§L Dio Cassius (44. 35) says that Julius Caesar appointed in his will
ἐπιτρόπους to Augustus ‘qui propter provectiorem aetatem curatores
luerint :’ these must have been magisterially confirmed. The reason why
testamentary appointment oi curators was never allowed was perhaps
that in the earliest lorm os the institution (the cura oi luciosi and prodigi)
a causae cognitio was required in order to settle whether the person
actually was furiosus and prodigus, and this would have seemed to admit
an undue interierence oi the magistrate with testamentary power.

ξ 2. This means only that a general curator could not be forced on a
minor: but he could be compelled to have one temporarily, ad certam
causam, in two cases: that mentioned here in the text (a judgment
against an undeiended minor being void, Dig. 42. 1. 45. 6), aud when his
creditor wished to discharge his debt and obtain a release, Dig. 4. 4.
7. 2.

Whether a minor who had a general curator could bind himself by
contract without the latter's consensus is disputed. The general rule
would seem to be that he could: ‘puberes sine curatoribus suis possunt
ex stipulatu obligari’ Dig. 45. 1. 101, though, without it, he could not hind
himself by an alienation, eg. sale or pledge, Cod. 2. aa. 3. But even
where he bound himseli without the curator’s consent the curator could
not be compelled to satisfy the creditor out of the minora property: and
the latter could usually obtain in integrum restitutio from the praetor.
