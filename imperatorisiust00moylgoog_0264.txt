Tisip] DE EXHEREDA Τ IONE LIBERORUM. 249

filius genitus suerit, exheres esto? Postumorum autem locoz
sunt et hi, qui in sui heredis locum succedendo quasi adgna-
scendo fiunt parentibus sui heredes. ut ecce si quis filium et
ex eo nepotem neptemve in potestate habeat, qula filius gradu
praecedit, is solus iura sui heredis habet, quamvis nepos quo· -
que et neptis ex eo in eadem potestate sunt: sed si filius eius
vivo eo moriatur aut qualibet alia ratione exeat de potestate
eius, incipit nepos neptisve in eius locum succedere et eo modo
iura suorum heredum quasi adgnatione nanciscuntur. ne ergo
eo modo rumpatur eius testamentum, sicut ipsum filium vel
heredem instituere vel nominatim exheredare debet testator,
ne non iure saciat testamentum, ita et nepotem neptemve ex
filio necesse est ei vel heredem instituere vel exheredare, ne
sorte vivo eo filio mortuo, succedendo in locum eius nepos
neptisve quasi adgnatione rumpant testamentum. idque lege
Iunia Velleia provisum est, in qua simul exheredationis modus
ad similitudinem postumorum demonstratur. Emancipatoss

under the lex Iunia Velleia, aa). 9, mentioned in ξ 2 inl. : and partly on
the authority of the jurist Salvius Julianus: see Poste's Gaius pp. 236-7.

For those who were in postumomm loco by adrogation or adoption
the law was not so simple. Gaius says (ii. 138-140) that a will was
avoided by the subsequent adoption ol a suus heres, even il the latter
was instituted heir in it: but this doctrine was disputed by Scaevola
(Dig. 28. 3. 18) and l'apinian (Dig. 28. 2. 23. 1), whose view was adopted
by Justinian, Dig. ib. 6. pr. On the other hand, if an extraneus was
disinherited in a will, and then was subsequently adopted or adrogated
hythe testator, the will was always avoided, Dig. 37. 4 8. 8 (‘exheredatio '
res in extraneo inepta est ³). The only exception to this was where a
son who had been emancipated or given in adoption was disinherited,
aud subsequently adrogated or readopted by his own natural father, the
testator, Dig. 28. 2. 23. pr. Probably the same rules applied to the
postumus suus by legitimation: his institution in a previously executed
will saved it, his exheredation did not.

ll the son of a filiusfamilias who had made 2 will of castrenseupecu-
litun was not therein instituted or disinherited, and then became suus
heres hythe grandfathers death, the will was avoided, Dig. 28. 2. 28. 1.

ln Ulpian's time it was not established that all male postumi sui must
be disinherited nominatim, though he says (reg. 22. 22) that if one in a
remoter degree than the first was disinherited inter ceteros, it was neces·
sary to give him a legacy lor the same reason alleged in this section, in

' respect ol postumae suae: hut he adds, sed tutius est nominatim eos
exheredari, et id observatur magis.
