rit. 16.] DE CAPITJS MINUTJONE. 149

Quod autem dictum est manere cognationis ius et post6
capitis deminutionem, hoc ita est, si minima capitis deminutio
interveniat: manet enim cognatio. nam si maxima capitis
deminutio incurrat, ius quoque cognationis perit, ut puta ser-
vitute alicuius cognati, et ne quidem, si manumissus luerit,
recipit cognationem. sed et si in insulam ,deportatus quis sit,
cognatio solvitur. Cum autem ad adgnatos tutela pertineat?
uon simul ad omnes pertInct, sed ad eos tanturn, qui proximo
gradu sunt, vel, si eiusdem gradus sint, ad omnes.

unimpaired so long as he did nothing to incur reproach from his lellow
burghers, but which was capable ol being either entirely destroyed or
partially lost : ‘existimatio est dignitatis illaesae status, legibus ac mori·
bus comprobatus, qui ex delicto nostro auctoritate legum aut minuitur
aut consumitur' Dig. 50. 13. 5. r. Existimatio was said to be ‘consumed' is
its foundation, the civitas, were forfeited by either maxima or media
capitis deminutio. ln other cases, where a man had been guilty of such
conduct as was held to justiiy a deprivation os some portion of his civil
rights and privileges, he was said to be branded with ignominia or nota,
and his existimatio to be ‘diminished ε’ ‘minuitur existimatio quotiens
manente libertate circa statum dignitatis poena plectimur, sicuti cum
relegatur quis, vel curn ordine movetur, vel cum prohibetur honoribus
. publicis iungi, vel curn plebeius fustibus caeditur, vel in opus publicum
datur, vel cum in earn causam quis incidit, quae edicto perpetuo infamiae
causa enumeratur’ Dig. 50. 13. 5. 1-3. The oldest form ol tninutio existi-
mationis can be traced back to an enactment probably comprised in the
Xll Tables, which declared citizens who committed certain crimes im-
probi and intestabiles: ‘cunr lege quis intestabilis iubetur esse, eo per·
tinet, ne eius testimonium recipiatur, et eo amplius, ut quidam putant,
neve ipsi dicatur testimonium’Dig.28.1.26. Similarly a man’s existi-
matio was affected, though perhaps less permanently, by the subscriptio
or nota censoria, lor which see General lntrod. p. 21. T he communest
cause os minutio,¹ however, was infamia, an institution doubtless known to
the old civil law, but which, as may be gathered from the passage cited
supr. from the Digest‚ was raised to an honourable prominence by the
care with which the praetor used it as an instrument of morality and
justice, and defined in the edict the circumstances under which it would
attach, and the penalties and disabilities which it would entail, for both
oi which see on Bk iv. 16. 2 ini. For a discussion of the question whether
infamia ever operated as a capitis deminutio see Mr. Poste's note on

Gaius i. 161.
