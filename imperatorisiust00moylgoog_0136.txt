parentum, quorum in potestate sunt. nam hoc fieri debere et
civilis et naturalis ratio suadet in tantum, ut iussum parentis

constituenda sponsalia. ln earnest of the engagement mutual gifts
(arrha sponsalicia) were usual, which were forfeited hya defaulting
party, who had also to restore those given by the other side; and this
forfeiture seems, with the exception of some social disapprobation, to
have been the only penalty incurred for breach in the time of the classical
Junsts

The transition from the state of betrothal to that of actual marriage
was not effected by any necessary form, religious or otherwise, but by
actual cohabitation, as evidenced by the wife going to live with the hus·
band, accompanied by maritalis affectio, of which the deductio in domum,
or taking home of the woman by the man, was regarded only as a proof.
By N ov. 74 4 5, Justinian introduced a compulsory form for the marriage
of imperial officials, but for the rest of the Roman world the old rule was
left standing.

From iustae nuptiae one has to distinguish nuptiae simply. Origin-
ally the former was the only kind of marriage known at Rome. Even,
however, in the time of the Republic there had grown into almost equal
recognition a matrimonium iuris gentium, a lawful wedlock of persons
between whom there was not connubium, which, inferior to iustae nuptiae
only in not creating patria potestas, was held in grem favour under
the empire. ln Justinian's time every free subject of the empire prac-
tically had connubium, so that the distinction between nuptiae and
iustae nuptiae, important before the edict of Caracalla, had ceased to
have any significance.

The marriage state was terminated (1) by either party dying or
manuring a slave. Where the slavery resulted from captivity, post-
liminium had not originally the effect of restoring the married condition,
but a fresh consensus was required if the parties still wished to be hus-
band and wife, Dig. 49. 15. 14 r. This rule, however, underwent a
gradual change, and eventually captivity was regarded as in no way
different from ordinary absence, proof being required of the absent
party's death before the other could contract another marriage, Nov.
¹¹7·11· (2) By‘incestus superveniens ;' eg. if a man adopts his daughters
husband, the latter thereby becomes his own wife’s brother, Dig. 23. 2.
67. 3; cf. this Title, passim. (3) Dy divorce. Upon this the Romans
held that as the essence of marriage lay in the maritalis affectio, it could
be terminated by the mere mind of either party no longer to live in wed-
lock with the other ; the continuance of the marriage depended on that
of the affectio. Either party was thus free to terminate the connection
at pleasure, and agreements surrendering this privilege were void : ‘libera
matrimonia esse antiquitus placuit, ideoque pacta ne liceat divertere non
valere constat' Cod. 8. 39. 2. lf the separation was effected by mutual
arrangement, it was usually called divortium, if by the act of one party
only, repudium : ‘in repudiis ver0, id est, renunciatione, comprobata sunt
haec verba: tuas res tibi habeto: item haec, tuas res tibi agito’ Dig.
