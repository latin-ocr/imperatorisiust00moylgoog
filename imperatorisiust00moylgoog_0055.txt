¹ ephemeral character ol the ius praetorium that tlte ius civile always

preserved its distinctness and its separate existence.

The political changes which took place in the years immediately
succeeding the death ol Julius Caesar are not unlrequently misunder-
stood. It has been usual to speak ol ‘the establishment of the
empire,' and thence to inser that the sorm ol constitution was revolu-
tionised, and an open despotism suddenly substituted lor the sree
Republic with which the Romans had now sor centuries been familiar.
The real lact is that formally the constitution remained republican
under and even long alter Augustus 3 the only outward change has
been not inappropriately described as the addition to the old magis-
tracies ol a new one, which was held for lite, and whose holder was
invested with an authority lar larger, because more compact‚ than that
of all the old magistrates together. On Augustus were conferred,
sometimes lor lile, sometimes for shorter periods‚ but always to be
renewed, the tribunicia potestas, the proconsulare imperium, tbe prae·
lectura morum, the supreme pontificate, and in lact all the highest
offices os state: but in each ol these capacities he acted merely asa
magistrate ol the Republic, whose outward forms he was studious to
observe. Hence, according to the theory of the constitution, the
supreme power continued to reside in the populus Romanus, and was
exerclsed, as before, in the two comitia lor elective and¹ legislative
purposes. Augustus himself voted among the tribes lilre any other
citizen, and the theoretical sovereignty ol the people remained intact
until the accession of Constantine.

The legislation ol the early emplre accordingly proceeded at first in
the same manner as it had been accustomed. Leges are still enacted
in the comitia, though usually introduced by the emperor in person, and
if by some other magistrate, always with his sanction; lor his tribu-
nicia potestas enabled him to veto any project which did not meet with
his approval. GaiuS, who belongs to the middle ol the second century,
speaks of this form ol enactment as still potentially subsisting: ‘lex est,
quod populus iubet atque constituit' (i. 3). But towards the end of the
first century legislatlou by the populus was becoming rare, and the last
lex ol which we have informationis an agrarian law ol Nerva (nn. 96-
98) mentioned in Dig. 47. ar. 3. r. The legislative authority ol the
senate endured longer. This had originated partly in its old probouleu·
tic functions, partly in its relation to the administration. In connection
with the latter, it would seem that ewen under the Republic its rights
had practically been admitted ol regulating the government ol the
provinces, maintaining religion, suspending or repealing laws in cases
