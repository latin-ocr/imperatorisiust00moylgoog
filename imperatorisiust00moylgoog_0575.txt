except loans of money, and to these it applied even if veiled beneath
some transaction ostensibly of a different nature ; ‘sed si fraus sit senatus
consulto adhibita, puta frumento vel vino vel oleo mutuo dato, ut his
distractis fructibus uteretur pecunia, subveniendum est filiofamilias’ Dig.
14. 6. 7. 33 aad the age or rank of the tilius by whom the money was
borrowed was immaterial: ‘in filiofamilias nihil dignitas facit quominus
senatus consultum Macedonianum locum habeat: nam etiamsi consul
sit vel cuiusvis dignitatis, senatus consulto locus est’ Dig. ib. 2. The
effect of the enactment was not to avoid the loan (so that it is weaker iu
its operation than the SC. Velleianum, p. 416 supr), but simply to refusean
action for its recovery, or, if an action were in fact granted by the praetor
because the facts were doubtful, to enable the defendant, if he could
prove his title to the benefit of the law, to repel the plaintifl' by exceptio
SC¹. Macedoniani. Thus the obligation to repay the money subsisted
naturaliter, so that condictio indebiti was excluded, though if the lilius
pald with money of his fathers, the latter could recover it by vindicatio
su long as the creditor still had it in his hands.

The senatusconsult, however, had no application in the following
cases. The filiusfamilias himself was liable (1) if he had a peculium
castrense or quasi-castrense, Dig. 14. 6. 2 ; (2) if aller becoming sui iuris
he ratilied the contract (Cod 4 28 2) either expressly or by implication ;
eg. by repaying part of the loan. Both filius and paterfamilias vvere
liable (1) if the lender had reason for believing the filiusfamilias to be
sui iuris, Dig. 14. 6. 3. pr. and 1. (2) If and so far as the loan was in rem
patris versum, Dig. ib. 7. 12 and 13. (3) If the paterfamilias consented
to the transaction, Cod. 4. 28. 2. Consent might be inferred from con·
duct, such as standing by and allowing the money to be lent, Dig. ib. 12
and 16, or his making the son his institor, or allowing him to trade with
a peculium profectitium. Subsequent ratification by the pater, express
or implied, had the same effect, Cod. 4. 28. 7. pr. (4) lf the loan was
contracted to pay a creditor against whom the senatusconsult could not
be pleaded, Dig. ib.7. 14. (5) ls the son at the time of borrowing the
money was a soldier, Cod. 4 28. 7. 1. (6) lf there was no genuine loan
owing to the lender’s defective capacity of alienation, as where he vas a
pupillus or alieni iuris, Dig. ib. 3. 2. lf the creditor was a minor, he
could get himself in integrum restitutus in spite of the senatusconsult,
Dig. 4, 4. 11. 7. The exceptio SC¹. Macedoniani could be pleaded also
by the filiusfamilias’ surety, ifthe latter had a ius regressus against him,
Dig. 14. 6. 9. 3.
