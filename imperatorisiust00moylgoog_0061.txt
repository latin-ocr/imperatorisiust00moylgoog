leading leature of this juristic interpretation is perhaps its strict reler-
ence to the civil law, as distinct from other jural elementa which were
beginning to intrude themselves into the system: ‘his legibus (XII
Tab.) latis coepit, ut naturaliter evenire solet, ut interpretatio desi-
deraret prudentium auctoritatem necessariam esse disputatione fori'
(Pomponius in Dig. r. a. a. 5); and this wilt, explain the curicus use
ol ius civile, already alluded to (note p. 28, supr), to indicate speci-
lically law made hythe prudentes. This limitation ol ‘interpretatio'
had, however, ceased in the time ol Cicero, who says (de Leg. i. 5) that
the jurists who were his contemporaries applied themselves also to the
praetorian edict, while their predecessors had not gone beyond the
ius civile. The sphere ol their activity was largcly extended on the
sall ol the lree Republic. Savigny has remarked (Hist. ol the Roman
Law in the llliddle Ages i. p. 25) that the art ol public speaking,
which in the time oi lreedom had been tlte first among the arts of
peace, had with the disappearance ol lreedom lost all power and
influence. Yet the Romans had from the earliest time devoted them-
selves more to law than to any other branch of public lile, and it was
accordingly in the study ol law that the highest and noblest intellecta
now engaged, and in which they found the completest satisfaction ol
, such aspiration's as were still tolerated by the empire ⁸. With them we
first get the idea ol a scientific knowledge ol the principles ol law or
J'urisprudence, a science which was entirely ol their creation. Its
lavourable and symmettical growth under their hands was due in no
small degree to a peculiarity which is worthy ol attention, namely, the
theoretical, scientific purpose ol the work by which it was elaborated,
or rather the complete adjustrnent which they effected between theory»
and practice, between principle and detail. The Roman jurists to
whom the science of law is most indebted held themselves alool from
the mechanical business which had formed a considerable portion ol
the vocation of the older prudentes, and left it to their pupils or to men
ol less repute than themselves. Their theory was thus always lull ol
lise, their practice always in harmony with and conducted with reference
to their principles ς with them ‘theory and practice stood tuone another
in the only possible true relation, that each paid due regard to the other!
Thus the practitioner could not reproach the scientific jurist with being
a mere theorist or dreamer, or the scientific jurist the practitioner with
