In the two cases hitherto considered (legitimi and secundum tabulas)
it was unlikely that the other party, who knew he was not heir,
would persist in the litigation; thus bonorum possessio became more
than interim possession, it had grown into an independent and im-
pregnable interest. lu this iorm it was employed by the praetor in
favour oi other persons to whom, though not heredes, it seemed
equitable to give a deceased man's property, which must often have
become vacans, the preyoi any occupant (Gaius ii. 52-56), by default
ol successore whom alone the narrow system of the Twelve Tables
regarded as having any title. If there were no legitimus, the posses·
sion was promised to the nearest cognatas, and, falling them, to the
survivor of a married couple (vir et uxor); and iu these cases, there
being ex hypothesi no heir to dispute the award, bonorum possessio
lost its character as a merely provisioual interest, and the cautio
which had been required lrom the grantes was dispensed with.
hloreover, by this development persons were benefited oi whom the
civil law had talren no notice, whence doubtless bonorum possessio
came definitely to be regarded as an independent scheme os suc·
cession, standing in contrast with that os the Twelve Tables The
bonorum possessio ol liberi, and that ol contra tabulas, both ol which
were corrigendi iuris civilis gratia, seem to have been introduced

no earlier than the fall ol the Republic, though the latter may have
existed from the first in iavour os the praeteritus suus or sua.

Eventually, too, bonorum possessio secundum tabulas underwent im·
portant modificatione. Originally, it was granted to an institutus in
a will scaled by seven witnesses‚ whether the latter was valid iure
civili or not ; with this question the praetor did not concern him·
sels, leaving it to be settled by the civil law claimant ab intestato, it
there were one, bringing hereditatis petitio. Alter contratabular
possession had been introduced, it was granted to the propounder
of the will il no one claimed contra tabulas. Hadrian enacted bya
rescript (Dig. 28. 3. ra. pr.) that if a will were ruptum agnatione
postumi, and the postumus pre-deceased the testator, the bonorum
possessor secuudum tabulas should be protected against the person
claiming ab intestato, unless a suus had been disinherited in the will.
A rescript oi hl. Aurelius (Gaius ii. 119-121) further provided that
bonorum possessio under a praetorian testameut (septem signis sig-
natum) should hold good even against the agnates: it availed against
the institutus iu a lormally valid prior will only if the person in-
stituted in the praetorian testament was also entitled ab intestato. ln
all other cases the intestate civil law heirs prevailed over the bonorum
