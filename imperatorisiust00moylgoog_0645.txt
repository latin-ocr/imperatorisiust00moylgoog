Personai actions on delict which were not penei, but reparatory (c. g.
condictio furtiva) claimed an incertum, and had a peculiar intentio ἒ
(e. g. si paret A. Α : N. N. pro lure damnum decidere oportere). These
three lorms oi intentio in personal actions—dare, dare lacere, and pro
damno decidere-correspond to the common Roman division oi
¹ obligations according as they consist in dando, iaciendo, or praestando:
and the two first, when standing alone, without the addition ‘ex fide
bona' to be shortly noticed‚ are characteristic oi the action knovnin
the formulary system as condictio. Condictio is either certi, triticam,
or incerti. (1) Condictio certi corresponds to the old 'legis actio
introduced by the lex Silia; it is the appropriate action for the re-
covery oi certa pecunia, and its intentio runs ‘ si paret A. A. ι N. N.
x milia sestertium dare oportere.’ (a) Condictio triticaria corresponds
to the legis actio as extended by the lex Calpurnia, and lies lorthe
recovery ol certa res ι its intentio runs ‘si pareri„ A. : N. N. fundum,
hominem, tritici x modios dare oportere.' (3) Condictio incerti is the
remedy where the obligation is to perform some personal act odicr
than a conveyance‚ and is usually brought upon a stipulation; hence
its more common name is actio ex stipulatu; the form of the intentio
is ‘quicquid dare iacere .. . oportet.¹

iii. Condictiones are called stricti iuris iudicia Contrasted with
them is another class ol actions in personam, descended irom iudicis
arbitrive postulatio, and called sometimes arbitria, but more properly
bonae fidei iudicia ¹. They arc enumerated in Gaius iv. 62, Bh. iv.
ό. 28 supn, the commonest oi theru being the actions on contracta iun's
gentium exclusive os mutuum. The name is derived from the addition
ol the words ‘ ex fide bona' in the Intentio (e. g. quicquid ob eam rem
A. A. : N. N. ex fide bona dare lacere oportet), which indicate that
the plaintili's demand is of something more ‘incertum’ even than
in condictio incerti; its vaiue is to be ascertained only by a carelii
baiancing and adjustment ol conflicting claims, and consequently the
judge is here allowed afar greater latitude of discretion 3 the procedure
is that oi equity rather than ol law ².

iv. Another division ol actions based upon structural difference oi
Intentio is that into actio directa and actio utilis, which grew out oi
’ the practice ol extending an action to cases which did not come within

¹ The term arbitrium in Roman law, in the sense olan action, means eitheran

actio arbitraria, p. 545 supr„ or a bonae fidei iudicium; aud the person who nis l

au action ol either os these classes is called arbiter as often as iudex.

tidei iudicia see on Bk. iv. 6. 28 supr.
