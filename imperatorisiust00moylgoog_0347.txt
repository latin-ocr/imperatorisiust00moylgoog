332 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK lllt

the one'is entitled to claim an act or forbearance 11010 the other. The
one, or creditor, has a right in personam, the other, or debtor, owes
to him a relative duty; both right and duty are conceived as obliga·
tiones, or as correlative parts of a single obligati0; but it is the n'ght,
01 creditor side, alone which is a res incorporalis, and owing to which
this department of law falls under the head of ‘ res' at all.

This is not so clear and above doubt as never to have been
questioned. The position 01 obligations between the law of lnherit·
ance and the law 01 Actions has led Hugo and others to regard them
as a portion 01 the latter rather than 01 the ius quod ad res pertinet;
a theory to some extent countenanced by the fact that in the Digest
(de obligationibus et actionibus, 44. 1ῑ)0011(ζο110(4. 10) actions and
obligations are treated together, and by the technical meaning 01
‘actio' as action in personam, in contrast with ‘petitio' or aetion in
rem, Dig. 44. 7. 08 ; 50. 16.178. a. It has even been attempted to
support this view by a statement of Theophilus in his commentary on
Tit. 13. pr. of this book, where he says, ‘Now that we have spoken
of persons and 01 things, we ought logically to treat 01 actions3 but
this arrangement, i.e. the treating 01 obligations first, is not inexcus-
able, for in discussing obligations one is implicitly discussing actions
als0, 01 which they are the mothers! But it is clear from his remarks
on Bk. iv. 6. pr, that Theophilus is preferring a fourfold division 01
the law, making obligationes a fourth and independent department
intermediate between res and actiones; and this cannot convince us
that Justinian 10 his Institutes intended to depart 11010 the arrange·
ment 01 Gaius: 101 although, had we the Institutes alone, a reason-
able suspicion might be justified by the fact that obligations are partly
treated in the third book, which 00 000 doubts begins with res, and
partly in the fourth, which no one doubts ends with actiones, yet this
is removed by our knowledge that Gaius concludes the subject 01
obligations in his third book, and devotes the whole 01 the fourth to
actions. Indeed, the enumeration of obligations among res incorpo-
rales in Bkii a. a, is sufficient proof in itself 01 the wrongness of
Hugo's theory.

The acts or events which give 1100 to this kind 01 legal relation
called obligatio are of course different from 000 another in character,
’ but they may be grouped with tolerable correctness in two principal
and two subordinate classes. One 01 the former, which is prominent
10 011 developed systems of law, is agreement; the other is delict,
which may here be defined with sufficient accuracy as wrong other
than breach 01 contract. But there are obligations which take their
