position as a defendant's cognitor under the older system, Gaius iv. 101 ;
his principal, and nothe, had to give security iudicatum solvi; either
alone (cautio) or with sureties (satisdatio). This security consisted oi
three clauses: ‘iudicatum solvi stipulatio tres clausulas in unum collatas
habet: de re iudicata, de re defendenda, de dolo malo’ Dig. 46. 7. 6. l
By the first ol these the defendant and his sureties engaged, in case the
action went against him, to restore the property to which it related, or
pay the damages assessed by the judge, Gaius iv. 89 ; hy the second, he
promised to defend the action 3 by the third, to indemnily the plaintiff
against malicious deterioration os the disputed property while it was in
bis hands. lt is not easy to see how, when the principal gave the
security ‘extra iudicium‚’ he could be said to become fideiussor sor his
own procurator, who clearly gave no security at all. Perhaps, as the
latter was responsible lor the conduct oi the desence, he was held to be
impliedly liable on the clauses de dolo and de re defendenda, and his
principal became answerable, as fideiussor, sor any prejudice which
might besall the plaintifl' through his delault in either ol these respects.
So far as satisfaction ol the judgment was concerned, be himself was
liable alone, and not the agent ; and ‘non intellegi posse, ut quis pro se
fideiuhendo obligetur’ Dig. 46. 1. 21. 2. Another difficulty is raised by
the passage in the text which accounts for the compulsory hypotheca by
the desire to bind the real defendant’s heire, lor they were in point os fact
already bound by his engagement iudicatum solvi. Perhaps this isto be
explained by supposing that lonnerly the sureties in this security were
sponsors or fidepromissors, whose liability did not descend to their
successore (Gaius iii. 120), and that these lines have been transcribed
from some old jurist into the Institutes by an oversight.
