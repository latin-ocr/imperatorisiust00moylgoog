with those oi stipulation and Real contract, are tersely noticed. Sale
is considered in Title 233 the principles relating to'the moment at
which the contract is held to be concluded, the necessity ol the price
'being fixed and in money, and the ‘periculum rei,' are clearly set
iorth, together with one· or two changes made in the law by Justinian
himself, and an incidental notice oi a subject touched upon elsewhere
in this part oi the book, the doctrine os negligence in contractual
'relations Locatio conductio, or hire, is discussed upon much the
‘same lines in Title 24, and in Title 25 are described the chief forms
oi pertnership, the relations oi partners inter se, and the modes in
which this contractis deterrnined. Title 26 is upon the subject of
agency, the species of which are classiiied according to the variatione
in the persons benefited by the agent's commission; the modes in
which that commission terminates, and the reciproca] duties oi agent
and principal, are also noticed. The question which is oi so much
practical importance in modern law as to the capacity os the agent to
bind and entitle his principal is passed over in silence, but is treated at
some length in Excursus IX inl. Quasi-contractual obligations are
illustrated in Title 27 by negotiorum gestio, indebiti solutio joint
owncrship and inheritance, and the relations oi guardian and ward, heir
and legatee; andTitle 29 deals with the discharge oi obligations, and
more particularly oi those which arise ex contractu 3 the chief modes

described are performance, accord and satisfaction, release, and substi· ·

tuted agreement. Assignment, of which some treatment might have
been looked sor, is discussed in the Excursus (V) on the general nature
oi'obligations.

The description here given oi the Roman contract system—ii we
may use that expression to indicate the aggregate oi actionable
agreements-is somewhat misleading. It must not be supposed
that in the time of Justinian, or even oi Gaius, no agreement was
ground to support an action which was neither expressed in the form
of stipulation, nor belonged to one or other oi the classes ol Real and
Consensual contracts. There had been a considerable advance in
two directions since the time when usage had restricted the term
‘contract' to denote the four classes oi agreement errumerated in
Title 13. Between the establishment ol the Empire and the age oi
the last great classical jurists the principle oi the Real contracte had
received a great development by the recognition oi the rule, that
where one party to any bilateral agreement whatsoever had performed
what he had undertahen, he had always a remedy by action to enforce
performance by the other. This great group of so·called ‘innominate’
