518 ntsTlTUTJONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. lv.

suerit, sed alio modo damnum alicui contigit, cum non sufficit
neque directa neque utilis Aquilia, placuit eum qui obnoxius
' suerit in lactum actione teneri: veluti si quis misericordia
ductus alienum servum compeditum solverit, ut fugeret.

ini. in the General Index, and sor the specific one mentioned in this
section cl. Dig. 19. 5. 11 ‘quia actionum non plenus numerus esset, ideo
plerumque actiones in factum desiderantur. Sed et eas actiones, quae
legibus proditae sunt, si lex iusta ac necessaria sit, supplet praetor in eo,
quod legi deest ; quod facit in lege Aquilia reddendo actiones infactum
accommodatas legi Aquiliae, idque utilitas eius legis exigit.² lt is difficult
to determine at all precisely the relation to one another ol this actio in
sactum and the actio utilis legis Aquiliae also mentioned in the text.
Justinian’s own statement here suggests the hypothesis that the actio
utilis was the proper remedy where the damage was done corpori, but not
corpore, while where it was not even done corpon' the injured person had
only an actio in factum3 but this distinction is not even hinted at by
Gaius iii. 219, and other passages in the Digest, some ol which are cited
below, are strongly against it. The only conclusion which seems to be
warranted is that in all cases which had been brought within the scope of
the statute by construction an actio in sactum lay, but that the actio
utilis bada less extensive application‚ or, as one oi the Scholiasts puts it,
‘nota etiam ex hoc capite, aliud esse in iactum, et aliud utilem Aquiliam
utilis quidem Aquilia est in iactum, at in lactum nonest utilisAquilia; haec
enim latius patet et aliis casibus competit! There seems to beno otber
difference between the two remedies, and, in particular, none in respect
ol their material result, though some writers maintain that by the actio
in sactum only simple damages were recoverable‚ but that the actio utilis
was penal in both senses os the lex Aquilia, ξ 9 supr. and note. For this
there is no textual authority, and the expression actio in factum ‘accom-
modata legi Aquiliae’ (Dig. ¹9· 5. rr, cited supr.) or ‘ad exemplum legis
Aquiliae' (Dig. 9. 2. 53) is distinctly against it.

The cases to which the penalties ol the lex Aquilia were extended by
construction, besides that already noticed in the note on p. 512, are as
follow:

(r) lndirect killing (corpori, non corpore): ‘Celsus autern multum
interesse dicit, occiderit, an mortis causam praestiterit, ut qui mortis
causam praestiterit, non Aquilia sed in sactum actione teneatur. Unde
affert eum, qui venenum pro medicamento dederit, et ait causam mortis
praestitisse, quemadmodum eum, qui furenti gladiurri porrexit, nam nec
hunc lege Aquilia teneri, sed in sactum' Dig. 9. 2. 7. 6. For this the text
before us prescribes actio utilis: cs. Dig. ib. 9. 3 ; ib. 11. 1.

(2) lndirect damage other than killing (corpori, non corpore): ior
examples see the text, and Dig. 9. 2. rr.5; ib. ²9· 53 ib. 3o 3; 9. r. ¹·71
