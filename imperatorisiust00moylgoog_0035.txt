state, in itseli, had nothing to do with private law ; ior their very
purpose is to place the two in a relation to one another which
previously did not exist: and that absence os opposition consists, not
in the domination of private law by the state, but os the state by
private law: that is to say, the state is constructed on private law
principles. The evolution ol private law out ol the state would be a
contradiction of all history ¹.' Nor is the lorce ol this argument in
any way wealrened by the admitted fact that the principal dispositione
known to early Roman law were effected under state supervision
(p. 18, supr). The object of this was to obtain a public guarantee
for the rights which they conferred3 a citizen who disputed such
rights would be resisting the authority ol the whole people. And it
is conceivable that the idea of law baclred by irresistible soree, with
which Austin has made us familiar, and which is peculiar to societies
in which the judicatura is and has long been organized on an effective
system, was developed out of this expedient os defending individual
rights, through the medium os a lorm, by the collective force of the
whole community: ‘das Concrete war hier wie so olt in der Ges·
chichte des rbmischen Rechts die Bmcle zum Abstracten3 aus dem
Schutz der Rechte entwickelte sich der Schutz des Rechts’

Like so many other irresponsible rulerS, the ‘decemviri legibus
, scribundis' were corrupted by the taste os power which they had
enjoyed; so much did they relish it that they attempted to make their
own office permanent, and to revolutionise the lorm ol government
by substituting themselves entirely lor the consuls and tribunes. Pre-
tending to make an ‘exaequatio iuris’ the main object ol their policy,
they set to worlr to attain it by reactionary measures; they were for
retaining the comitia curiata only lor religious purposes, and for
abolishing the comitia tributa altogether ; thus the plebeians would
lose their organization, and so their very existence as an order, while
the privileges ol the patricians would be perpetuated, though under
sorms slightly altered or disguised. The plebs saw through the
design, and (a. c. 449) resorted once again to the well-tried stratagem
ola secession. The patn'cian opposition at once crumbled to no-
thing, and the old constitution, with its consuls and tribunes, was
restored. By a lex os the consuls, Horatius and Valerius (rac. 449), it
was enacted ‘ut quod tributim plebs iussisset populum teneret ;’ words
which must not be understood to mean that the comitia tributa
thereby received a legislative authority co·ordinate and coextensive
