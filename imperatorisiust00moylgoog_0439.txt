Locatio et conductio proxima est emptioni et venditioni
isdemque iuris regulis consistunt. narn ut emptio et venditio
ita contrahitur, si de pretio convenerit, sic etiam locatio et
conductio ita contrahi intellegitur, si merces constituta sit et
competit locatori quidem locati acti0, conductori vero con-

lducti. Et quae supra diximus, si alieno arbitrio pretium
permissum suerit, eadem ct de locatione et conductione dicta
esse intellegamus, si alieno arbitrio merces permissa luerit.

nit. xm. In many points, as is observed io the text, the rules ol
locatio conductio are (mutatis mutandis) identical with those os sale.
The contract is concluded assoon as the parties ,are agreed upon the
thing to be let and the hire money (merces), which must be pecunia
numerata, ξ 2, except that the rent oi agricultural land may be paid in
kind, the amount being fixed either absolutely or at a certain proportion
os the yearly fruits, Cod 4 65. 21. So too the merces, like the pretium,
must be certa and vera, hut need not be iusta, understandiug these
terms in the senses already given to them under Tit. 23; nor, finally,
need the letter be dominus ol that which he lets (Dig. rn 2. 7 ς ib. 9 pr.
and 6); else subletting would have been impossible.

Transacrions os three different kinds are included under this contract:
(1) Locatio conductio rerum, the letting by one (locator) and hiring by
another (conductor) ol a thing moveable or immoveable (eg. a house
with its premises, in which case the hirer was called inquilinus: or
agricultural land, when he was called colonus, Bk. ii. r. 36 supe), or
even os a res incorporalis, e. g. a usufruct, Dig. 7. 1. 12. 2 ; ib. 38.

(2) Locatio conductio operarum, the letting by one (locator) of his
services only to another (conductor), as in all contracte of free service.

(3) Locatio conductio operis, where one (conductor) engages to execute
a specific piece ot work, eg. build a house, a ship, a car-mage, etc, sor
another (locator). Here the ordinary use os the terms describing the
parties is inverted, the one who contracts todo the work, and who we
should say is hired, being regardedas the hirer. .
