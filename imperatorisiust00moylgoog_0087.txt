it, was naturally not backward in calling his master's attention to this
imperfectiora. Justinian, therefore, in aar. 534, appointed a new com-
mission, consisting of Tribonian, as president, and four otherS, to revise
the Code 01 au. 529. Within a few months the latter, and also the
constitutions issued after its enactment, were deprived 01 all authority,
and withdrawn from circulation, their place being taken by a new Code,
known as the ‘codex repetitae praelectionis,' in which were incor-
porated Justinian's own constitutions, as well as many others which
the earlier Code had not contained: some again which had stood in
the latter were now omitted, and there were numerous alterations and
interpolationS‚ Tribonian sparing no pains to make the revision as
complete as possible. The codex repetitae praelectionis was promul·
gated on Nov. 16, 534, with statutory force from the ensuing a9th of
December. It consisted 01 twelve bookS, and in arrangement followed

Δ very closely the order of the Digest.

The adversaries of codification have made great capital out 01 an
error into which its advocates have sometimes fallen, and which con-
sists in supposing that a good Code dispenses with the necessity 01
any further legislation3 they have even accused Justinian of believing
that in his three great bodies of law was summed up the perfectiora
of human wisdom, and that they would suffice, without addition or
alteration, to determine for all time the rights and duties 01 his sub-
jects. Itis quite certain that Justinian never believed anything 01 the
kind. His main purpose had been to set the law upon a solid foun-
dation, and to cast it in a form which his successors would not lightly .
venture to alter; by the completeness of his work he hoped to endow
his subjects with the inestimable blessing ofa legal system pruned of
all relics of antiquity, adequate in substance, and so judiciously ar-
ranged as to reduce the necessity 01 future change to a minimum.
But within five years to have entirely recast a large portion of his own
work might well arouse the suspicion, that the law had lost all its old
stability ; that the legislatore had become too active; that as the first
Code had been thrust aside to make room for a second, so the second
would soon be swept away in favour 01 a third, and that in the conf ·
sion which such constant change could not fail to produce the many-
sided security which all law is intended to guarantee would cease to
exist. In his publication of the codex repetitae praelectionis Justinian
deemed it necessary to disarm all fear of such atendency. He ex·
pressly recognised the probability, if not the necessity, 01 subsequent
change, and enacted that constitutions issued after the publication of
the Code should be formed into a distinct collection, under the title 01
