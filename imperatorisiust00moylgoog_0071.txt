ratio. But among the peoples which composed the Eastem Empire,
and which, were Roman in name only, it was inevitable that the
universal should gain tbe preponderance over the particular y'ural
clement, as more favourable to the survival of the legal system beyond
the life of the individual nation; the part which was ‘civitatis pro·
prium' and strictly national could not fail to decay and gradually
disappear. Old legal dispositione, such as mancipatio and in iure
cessio, were practically superseded by free forms peculiar to no single
nation, and simultaneously the distinctions of cives, Latini, and pere-
grini ceased to have any real meaning, even if they were still oc-
casionally to be found; thus the old separation of ius civile and ius
gentium rapidly tended to disappear by the former becoming ab·
sorbed in and swallowed up by the latter. Secondly, it is to be
observed that Constantine had formally made Christianity the religion
of the empire which he ruled, and the effecta of this began to show
themselves at once in the field of private law. There was thus in-
fused into both legislation and judicature the spirit of a higher equity
and a diviner justice than had been familiar to the classical jurists,
which left its traces during this period on many ol the rules relating
to slavery, colonatus, marriage, concubinage, and patria potestas.
Justinian himself legislated openly in favour of the Church; for err·
amples of this reference may be made to the index to the text
(s. v. ‘Church'). Lastly, the constitutional changes which have
been brielly noticed produced modifications in private law through
the revolution which they effectcd in judicature, and consequentiy
in civil procedure, and which will be treated in a later part of this
boolr,

The legislative authority by which the legal changes thus generally
described were introduced requires sonte notice. The old magistrates
of the populus had now formally been transfonned into imperial
officials, and we can hardly believe that the latter could have deemed
themselves competent to exercise the praetor’s fonction of harmonis·
ing the 'strictum ius' with the ‘ius aequum' by their own independent
action. ‘Ex abundanti cautela’ however, Constantine issued a con·
stitution expressly forbidding them to attempt any such taslr: ‘inter
aequitatem iusque interpositam interpretationem nobis solis et oportet
’ et licet inspicere'(Constantine in Cod r. 14. ι). Nor is it to be ex·
pected that, under such conditions as those of the Eastern Empire,
new law could be begotten by usage. Usage or custom, so far as it
is fitted to become lav, is grounded upon a common apprehension
of an unuritten rule, upon a common conviction that so and so is
