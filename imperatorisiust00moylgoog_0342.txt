different view is talren hy Puchta, who connects the earliest protection
ol Possession with the primitive sonu oi Real Action. In this, both
plaintiff and defendant were, until decision oi the suit, regarded by
the law as equally entitled to the dominium. It was necessary, how-
ever, that one oi them should he magisteriallyiostated in, the pos-
session os the disputed property pending litigation, and we leam from
Gaius (iv. πό) how such interim possession was awarded. Having
been magisterially awarded, it must also be magisterially protected,
and this was done by an interdict 3 aremedy which oame subsequently
to be used lor the protection of all Possession, independently ol a
peuding suit.

Mr. Hunter (Roman law¹ pp. 195-222) believes that Possessio
entirely changed· its meaning in. the course of Roman legal history.
In origin he connects it with the technical incapacity oi aliens to own
property iure civili rather than with the occupatiore of ager publicus
aud maintains that it properly means Equitable or Gentile ownership.
When, after the edict of Caracalla, all subjeets of the Empire prac-
tically became cives, its functious, in this connection, were exhausted,
and it ‘came to have precisely the same meaning that it has in every
system ol law ; itis a temporary separation between the person
exercising rights and the person invested by law with rights! ’

There is no evidence oi this change of meaning, and nothing to
show that the Roman. lawyer's idea of Possessio differed inthe time
of Justinian srom what it had been in that ol Cicero, or that he con-
ceived Possession as otherwise than the very antipodes ol dominium
(⁶ nihil commune habet possessio cum proprietate' Dig. 4¹· a. 12. r);
or, finally, that the ‘gentile’ ownership os the alien (p. 187 supr.) was
specially protected by interdicts; he recovered his property, not by
an interdict, but by areal action, fictitia or utilis perhaps, but still
aremedy which recognised his proprietorship. On the other hand,
as all Possession, whether iusta or iniusta, whether bona lide or mala
fide, was protected by interdiets, to dvell upon the close resemblance,
the almost complete material identity, between many cases oi bona
fide Possession, and Equitable ownership, as Mr. Hunter does, is not
to the point. The actio Publiciana was open to any possessor whose
Possession could ripen by usucapio into ownership; hut his interest
was more than Possession ; it was inchoate or Bonitarian ownership,
or, adopting an expression oi Mr. Poste’s (Gaius p. 642), we may
say that the ius in rem, arrd the interdict-possession, are distinct
though concurrent. The lallacy oi arguing that, because many cases
ol (bonafide) Possession are equivalent to Bonitarian ownership,
