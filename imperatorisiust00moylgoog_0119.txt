104 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. l.

liberis multae differentiae sunt. aut enim ingenui sunt aut
libertini.

between absolute slavery and complete legal freedom there were two inter-
mediate conditions. The first of these is that oi the statu liber (ᾳυί
statutam et destinatam in tempus vel conditionem libertatem habet 'Dig.
40. 7, 1. pr.) ; the other is that nithe slave who was said ‘in libertate esse,'
i.e. who was manumitted in some mode not recognised as conferring tull
legal freedom (note ou Tit. 5. 1 ini), and who therefore remained a slave
in the eye os the law, though protected by the magistrate in the actual
enjoyment ol liberty.

From these cases differ certain others in which a person, though
actually free, was subject to an external control which limited his freedom,
and placed him to aconsiderable degree in the position of a slave : (r) the
free person bonafide serviens, ie. who thinks he is a slave; in some
matters, especially with regand to acquisitiou, he was treated as a slave,
and all that he acquired under definite conditione belonged to his quasi
dominus ; see Bk. ii. 9.4 int, Gaius ii. 92· (2) The auctoratus, who hired
himself out as a gladiator, Gaius iii. 1993 the hirer could sue by actio
furti if he were removed stom his control. The gladiatorial lights were
prohibited by Constantine, Cod. 11. 43. 1. (3) lt a prisoner of war was
redeemed, bis owner had akind ol lien on him until the whole redemption
sum was paid, and so long the ius postliminii was suspended. (4) The
debitor addictus under the middle law of bankruptcy did not become his
creditor's slave, but was bound to worlt sor him untilthe dent was satisficd;
see Gaius iii. 199 lor a parallel between him and the auctoratus. (5) The
free person in mancipio, sor which see note on Tit. 8. pr. ini. (6) The
colonus. Coloni (in this sense) were persons inseparably attached stom
birth to the soil ol some particular estate or district (glebae adscriptum
purposes ol cultivation ; they were personaily lree, but as it were slaves
of the land, ‘licet conditione videantur ingenui servi tamen terrae ipsius
cui nati sunt existimentur' Cod rt... 51. r ; under the later Empire they
composed the greater part ol the agricultural population. ln many
respects they were completely assimilated to slaves ς thustheir property
was called peculium, and was considered, like themselves, an appendage
nithe soil, and il they ran away they could be recovered by real action:
sor a longer notice of thern see Mr. Poste's note on Gaius iii. 146. One
theory of the origin ol colonatus is. that it is to be traced to the Roman
practice oi distinguishing between town and country slaves (familia
urbana and rustica); the latten being engaged in tillage, seem always
to have enjoyed a certain sreedom of action, and carne more and more
to be regarded as accessions to the land ; their position was actually
much the same as that oi the colonus, except that the status ol the
latter was a legal one, and it is urged that the transition from the un·
sree to. the free condition perhaps resulted lrom some statute empower·
ing domini to manumit tural slaves on condition os their remaining
