senate oi his resolution to codisy the constitutions os Constantinel
(au. 306-337) and all his successors by means oie commission oi
nine persons: ‘Ad similitudinem Gregoriani atque Hermogeniani
codicis cunctas colligi constitutiones decernimus, quas Constantinus
inclytus et post eum divi principes nosque tulimus, edictorum viribus
aut sacra generalitate subnixas' (Cod. Theod. 1. r. 5). Nothing, how-
ever, was done till ao. 435, when a fresh commission os sixteen per·
sons was appointed lor the purpose, with power to make alterations
iu individual constitutions. The result was the Theodosian code, pro·
mulgated in February au. 438, with statutory force srom and alter the
commencement ol au. 439, as the only authority lor the ‘ius principale,’
or imperial legislation, from Constantine I to that date. It consisted
oi sixteen books, arranged separately in Tities and rubrics, and the
constitutions in each Title were placed in chronological order. The
first live books were arranged on the plan ol the commentaries on the
Edict, and contained most os the enactments relating to private law.
The sixth to the eighth books consist principally oi constitutional
and administrativa ordinances ; the ninth is criminal law; the tenth
and eleventh relate to the financial system, and in part to procedure;
the twellth to the fifteenth, to the constitution and administration of
towns and other corporations, and the sixteenth conmins the eonsti-
tutions which deal with the church and the ecclesiastical system in
general. This code was accepted in the West as well as in the East,
and partly thus, partly by the ‘law of Citations' oi twelve years* earlier
date, unilonnity os law was secured throughout the two halves ol the
empire. Precautions were also talren against subsequent divergence:
the two governments agreed that constitutions which either might
find occasion to make should be communicated by the one to the other,
and subject to revision by mutual consent be published by both legis·
latures; in desault ol this procedure they should have no universal
validity. ln contradistinction to the code, such single enactments
were called novellae leges or novels 3 a number oi them were issued by
Theodosius, au. 448, and confirmed by Valentinian Ill in the West
in the following year. Thejoint style oi enaotrnent was actually
lollowed till an. 455, and there are several collectione oi novels which
belong to this period. From au. 455 the tie between the two empires
was greatly wealrened though Anthemius (au. 467-472) published
in the West an enactment issued in the East by Leo: sormally‚ how·
ever, the connection was maintained, so that the new constitutions still
bore the names ol both emperors, though the place os their issue
or the province oi the magistrates to whom they were addressed
