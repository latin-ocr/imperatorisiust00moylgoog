490 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV.

Privata code. The fourth Book of Gaius would seem to be an ill-
arranged attempt to deal with actio in both of these aspecta. It can-
not be contended that it deols solcly with Remedia] rights: Gaius'
own explanation oi the term actio in his opening paragraphs shows
that he is thinking os an ‘action' rather than of a ‘right ol action,'
based, as it is, upon peculiarities oi Procedure and Pleading. In
point of fact avery considerable proportion of the Book deals with
Procedure pure and simple: in other words, ‘Procedure is treated
partly indeed in its formal character, but still more in its material
character: . . . . that is to say, not so iar as it is merely the method
of realiaing pre-eristing rights, but rather so far as its stages are titles
which, like Dispositions and Torta, themselves originale new rights
and new obligations ¹.'

The compilers oi the Institutas, however, seem to have had a very
inadequate conception oi Gaius' scheme, and indeed to have troubled
· themselves very little in this part oi the work to follow out consistently
the principle os arrangement for which they were indebted to him.
Strictly speaking, of course, all the Tities between the fifth and the
end of the Book should have related to actions in some sense or
other: but they seem to have considered it better to give the heading
‘de actionibus' to a single Tide (6), in which all conceivable rights
ol action are classified upon various principles oi division, and to
append to this a number of subsidiary Titles dealing mostly with
topics discusscd by Gaius in a iar closer and more logical connection
with his main subject. The efiect of this is to give an air oi deadness
to the whole treatment, and to disable the compilers from justiiying
the place assigned in the iourth Book to some matters ior which
Gaius himself might possibly have offered some reasonable delence.
For instance, il it is right to describe in Book Ill the extent to which
a paterfamilias profits by the contracts of a son in his power, ora
master by those os his slave (Tit. 28), that too must be the proper
placeto explain what corresponding liability he incurs by them: but
this is discusscd in Book IV, Tit. 7, while Tities 8 and 9, though
placed where they are alter Gaius, would have occupied a sar more
logical position between Titles 5 and 6, in connection with Delict and
Quasi-delict. No doubt this sailure to carry out the original plan ol
arrangement is in a large measure to be explained by the great change
which had occurred in the nature ol Procedure proper between the
composition oi the two works. The mode in which an action was
conducted in Justinian’s time was so formless, so free irom the tram-
