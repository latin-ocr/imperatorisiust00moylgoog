EARLIER HlSTORl' OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 6ιῇ

covered by the plaintid in a Roman action on delict attest the nature
ol the practice, though in them the ‘penalty' is usually lixed by the
state, and not by the parties ¹. This less barbarous method ol settling
disputes and claims is familiar to every one who has any acquaintance
with the law ol the Germanic tribes. Mr. Kemble observes¹ that under
hogio-Saron law there was hardly any wronga man could suffer which
could not be atoned lor bya money payment. At Rome, so lar as
we can judge, it was confined to delict; ior breach ol contract the
ultimate remedy, even in historical times, remained the right ol arrest
and detention ; the debtor who could not, or would not, discharge his
obligations lell a victim to the severe process oi manus iniectio; he
was sold into loreign slavery, or put to death. Thus ‘the remedy for
a wrong to property was against the person: ior awrong to the person
it was against the property,' and this explains why actions on delict,
even when partly rei persecutoriae, ‘in-heredem non dantur! Adelict
calls lor the exercise ol private vengeance, which, however, has nothing
to act upon as soon as the wrongdoer is dead; his heir succeeds to
his universitas iuris, ol which his leuds and hostilities are no part3
and as the poena is paid as the price of exemption from personal
hostility, it must be paid by the wrongdoer and no one else.

limitation, as anarchy began to give way to order, providing lor the
establishment and rendering certain ol claims os man against man.
ln the caseos awrong ora debt whose existence no one could doubt,
the system might, as things stood, seem tolerable enough ; but it could
not long be endured it every pretended injury or obligation were to
entitle the complainant to proceed thu-s against the obJ'ect ol his ani-
mosity. The expedient which seems to have suggested itsell to the
primitive Romans was to require clear and adequate evidence ol every
right or wrong which was not otherwise beyond question, and to
attribute to the witnesses a kind of interest in the realization ol justice,
by identiiying them, in a sense, with the person who was supported
by their testimony; it the latter were compelled to resort to sell-
redress, they were under a moral obligation to afford him active
assistance3 in deiault they became no less· improbi and intestabiles
than the false or recalcitrant witness ola mancipation ⁸. Α ‘testis' is
conceived, originally, less as a witness, in the modern sense, than as

ol actual retaliation, the plaintill was allowed to fix its amount himself, Gaius iii.
