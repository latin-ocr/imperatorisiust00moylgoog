26 INTRODUCTION.

fall of the Republic produced few constitutional changes which left
their mark on private law or on the form of direct legislation. The
gradual extension of the Roman dominion over Italy, and then even
beyond its confines into Gaul and Spain, Greece, Asia, and Africa,
resulted in a constant increase in the value of the Roman civitas, and
in a perpetual struggle for the acquisition of it and the privileges
which it conveyed on the part of the Italian allies of the city. Their
rebellion ninety years before Christ, and the legislation (leges Iulia
and Plautia Papiria) by which they became full citizens of Rome,
are too well known to need repetition; but the political weight which
numerically they deserved was denied thern by their not being fairly
distributed among the thirty-five existing tribes, but probably among
eight of thern only. The establishment‚ however, by Rome of colonias
at various points inber dominions had led to a distinction of civil
rights which subsequently became of some prominence, and which
therefore requires a brief notice. The earliest colonias of this kind
consisted of Roman citizens, who retained their full rights of civitas
even in their new home. Contrasted with them are what are called
‘coloniae Latinae,’ by which we should understand Roman colonies
whose members enjoyed only the ius Latii or Latinitas. These
colonia Latinae were of two kinds, those which originated‚ like the
old Roman colonies, in the actual ‘deductio’ or leading of a number
of citizens to a new residence amid a conquered population, which
was thereby to be awed into submission, and those which existed as
townships before, but received the character of Latin colonies, without
change in their inhabitants, by statutory enactment. The ius Latii
comprised certain of the rights enjoyed by a full Roman citizen, and
some of them which were not possessed by the municipia and prae·
fecturae in various parts of Italy upon which Rome had conferred a
limited civitas. The inhabitants of a municipium or praefectura had,
before the leges lulia and Plautia Papiria, no political rights (suffra-
gium and honores), nor in all probability had they the connubium;
but they had the commercium, and consequently could hold property
and make contracts and wills exactly like full Roman citizens. The
chief advantage of Latinitas over the limited civitas of a municeps was
that if a citizen of a Latin colony served therein the office of a superior
magistrate he thereby acquired the full citizenship of Rome (Gaius i.
96); other modes were subsequently introduced in which ‘Latius’
could become perfect Quirites, and this capacity of rising to the
Roman citizenship is the distinctiva feature of the ius Latii as a legal
status. After that, by the leges Iulia and Plautia Papiria, the Italian
