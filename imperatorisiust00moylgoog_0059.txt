44 INTRODUCTION.

legislation: ‘et hoc non primum anobis dictum est, sed ab antiqua
descendit prosapia, quum etipse Iulianus, legum et edicti perpetui
subtilissimus conditor, in suis libris hoc retulit, ut, si quid imper-
fectum inveniatur, ab imperiali sanctione hoc repleatur; et non ipse
solus scd et divus Hadrianus, in compositione edicti et senatus con·
sulto, quod earn secutum est, hoc apertissime definivit, ut si quid
in edicto positum non inveniatur, hoc ad eius regulas eiusque con-
iecturas et imitationes possit nova instruere auctoritas' (Justinian in
Const. ‘tanta’ de Confirm. Digest. ξ 18). ’

The mention oi the responsa prudentium among the sources ol the
ius civile makes it necessary to speak of the work done by the jurist
class in the development oi Roman law3 and as it was to the
jurists that that law owed what scientific form it possessed, besides
many oi its other special men'ts, it will not be amiss to discuss this
subject with some iullness. The names oi the early prudentes who
lived under the free Republic are collected by Pomponius in Dig. r.
z. a. 35-39; the first is that of Papirius, whose compilation oi the leges
regiae has been already noticed. These earliest lawyers are styled
prudentes not because their knowledge of the law was more scientific,
less empirical, than that oi other men, but rather because they knew it
more luily; a philosophical treatment of law had hot yet commenced‚
and such distinction as there was between their legal knowledge and
that of the ordinary citizen was quantitative rather than qualitative.
The first condition of their existence as a professional class was the ces·
' sation ol the pontifices to he ‘iuris conditores,' and the liberation of pri-
vate law from the letters ol the ius sacrum3 it has been suggested that

this was efiected in the main by the incorporation os the plebeian clement ,

in the state. The direction oi their legal activity is denoted by Cicero
(de Orat. i. 48) hythe four terms respondere, cavere, agere, and scribere.
Respondere expressed the delivery ol opinions (‘ iuris civilis scientiam
publice profiteri ’) when consulted by either judges or private persons;
cavere, the advising more definitely on legal matters, such as the proper
mode of concluding some transaction, or os enforcing a right in the
courts ; agere, the actual participation in the process as patronus, or
by presently superintending a legal disposition; scribere, the draiting
oi technical documents in proper legal phrase, the more mechanical
part oi the labour being perhaps undertaken by clerks or secretaries
But the most prominent of their iunctions, the capacity in which the
ordinary citizen had most frequent occasion to consuit them, was as
advisers on the practice oi the law. The ordinary citizen could not
be acquainted with the complicated forms of procedure, or master the
