legitimo matrimonio natus est. et ideo si quis per impera·
torem sive apud praetorem vel apud praesidem provinciae
non extraneum adoptaverit, potest eundem alii in adoptionem
odere. Sed et illud utriusque adoptionis commune est, quod
et hi, qui generare non possunt, quales sunt spadones, adoptare
10 possunt, castrati autem non possunt. Feminae quoque adop-
tare non possunt, quia nec naturales liberos in potestate sua

' habent: sed ex indulgentia principis ad solatium liberorum
11 amissorum adoptare possunt. Illud proprium est illius adop-
tionis, quae per sacrum oraculum fit, quod is, qui liberos in
potestate habet, si se adrogandum dederit, non solum ipse
potestati adrogatoris subicitur, sed etiam liberi eius in eiusdem
fiunt potestate tamquam nepotes. sic enirn et divus Augustus
non ante Tiberium adoptavit, quam is Germanicum adoptavit:
ut protinus adoptione facta incipiat Germanicus Augusti nepos
12 esse. Apud Catonem bene scripturn refert antiquitas, servi si
a domino adoptati sint, ex hoc ipso posse liberari. undeet

§ 8. One could not readopt an adoptive child whom one had emanci-
pated or given in adoption, Dig. 1. 7. 37. 1, though this could be done
with a natural child, in which case the latter was, in most respects, as if
he had never left the family: but in relation to his own children, who
had remained in their grandfathers power, his position was different:

γ ‘. . . mortuo (avo) nepos in patris non revertitur potestatem' Dig. 1. 7. 41.
Again, adoptive did not, like natural children, retain the ius liberorum
after emancipation, Bk. iii. 1. 11 inf. For other minor differences be-
tween a natural and an adoptive child cf. Tit. 25 pr. inf, fragm. Vat.
169, 196, Tac. Ann. 15. rp

ξ 9. After Justinian’s changes, described on b 2 supr, it was of course
impossible for a spado to adopt plene, because none could do this but a
natural ascendant, and ex vi termini he could have no issue, but he
could adrogate.

§ 10. The earliest instance of this quasi-adoption by women of which
we know is that of Galba by his stepmother, Suet. Galba 4: it was first
generally permitted by Diocletian and Maximian, in cod. 8. 48. 5. Chil-
dren thus adopted could of course not be in potestas, but the eet produced
the relation of parent and child, and thus conferred on the latter rights
of intestate succession, and to bring the querela inofficiosi testamenti
(Bk. ii. 18 inf), if passed over in the adoptive mother's will.

§11. For the adoption of Tiberius by Augustus cf. Tac. Anu. 4 57,
Suet. Tiberius 15.

§ 12. lt is not clear whether Cato was thinking of adrogation of a slave

by his own dominus, or of the master’s giving him in adoption to a third
