546 INS TIT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [thulv.

viana, quae etiam hypothecaria vocatur: in personam veluti
quibus de eo agitur, quod aut metus causa aut dolo malo
factum est, item qua id,qu0d certo loco promissum est, petitur.
ad exhibendum quoque actio ex arbitrio iudicis pendet. in
his enim actionibus et ceteris similibus permittitur iudici ex
bono et aequo secundum cuiusque rei de qua actum est naturam
aestimare, quemadmodum actori satisfieri oporteat.

period see Excursus X inf. Under justinian they may best be described
as actions in which delivery or production of specific property, or specific
perlormance of an agreement, would be decreed, the defendant being
condemned in full damages only where execution of this decree was
impossible. Where the object of the action was restitution, it was
enforced by the strong arm of the law ; ‘qui restituere iussus iudici non
paret, contendens non posse se restituere, si quidem habeat rem, manu
militari officio iudicis ab eo possessio transfertur, et fructuum duntaxat
omnisque causae nomine condemnatio fit: sivero non potest restituere,
si quidem dolo fecit, quominus possit, is quantum adversariis in litem
sine ulla taxatione in infinitum iuraverit, damnandus est: si vero nec
potest restituere, nec dolo fecit quominus possit, non pluris, quarn quanti
res est, id est, quanti adversarii interfuit, condemnandus est. llaec sen·
tentia generalis est, et ad omnia, sive interdicta, sive actiones, et sivein
rem sive in personam sint, exquibus ex arbitratu iudicis quid restituitur,
locum habet! lt is not improbable indeed that this direct intervention
of the state to compel perlormance of the act demanded occurred when·
ever such performance was possible (eg. ‘exhihere cogendus est' Dig. ια
4. 8). Interdicts which were restitutoria and exhibitoria, and the actions
depositi, commodati, locati, and rei uxoriae, when their object was
restitution, belonged to this class of remedy, besides the instances given
in the text ; their leading characteristic (apart frum the decree of specific
restitution, production, or performance) being that, if the defendant is
unable through his own fault to do what is demanded of him, the
damages to be paid are fixed by the plaintiff on oath (iusiurandum iu
litem).

justinian's mention of actions demanding payment of money (solutio)
as arbitrariae seems to relate only to the actio de eo quod certo loco, etc,
for which see on Bk. iii. ις. 5 supr. For noxal actions see Tit.8 inf.

The actio ad exhibendum (for which cf. Tit. 17. 3inf.) was of·a pre·
liminary nature, enabling a plaintiff who could not pursue his right
without theproduction of an object to enforce such production upon any
one who was able to make it: ‘exhibere est facere in publico potestatem,
ut ei, qui agat, experiundi sit copia’ Dig. ro 4. 2, ‘sciendum est adversus
possessorem hac actione agendum non solum eum, qui civiliter, sed et
eum, qui naturaliter incumbat possessioni ’ ib. 3. 15. The right to which
the action was subsidiary might be in personam, as where a plaintiff
wishes to bring a noxal action, hut is not sure of the precise slave
