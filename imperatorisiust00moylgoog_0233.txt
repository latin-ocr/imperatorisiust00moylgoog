1 Sed aliquando etiamsi maxime quis bona fide rem possederit,
non tamen illi usucapio ullo tempore procedit, veluti is quis
liberum hominem vel rem sacram vel religiosam vel servum

2lugitivum possideat. Furtivae quoque res et quae vi pos-
sessae sunt, nec si praedicto longo tempore bona fide pos-
sessae suerint, usucapi possunt: nam furtivarum rerum lex
duodecim tabularum et lex Atinia inhibet usucapionem, vi

3possessarum lex Iulia et Plautia. Quod autem dictumest
furtivarum et vi possessarum rerum usucapionem per legem
prohibitam esse, non eo pertinet, ut ne ipse sur quive per vim
possidet usucapere possit: nam his alia ratione usucapio non
competit, quia scilicet mala fide possident: sed ne ullus alius,
quamvis ab eis bonafide emerit vel ex alia causa acceperit,
usucapiendi ius habeat. unde in rebus mobilibus non lacile
4procedit, ut bonae lidei possessori usucapio competat. nam
qui alienam rem vendidit vel ex alia causa tradidit, lurtum

analogy os Theodosius ll’s prescription ol actions, he enacted that thirty
years' possession ol property, moveable or immoveable, should conler
ownership, whether it admitted oi the ordinary usucapio or no, and even
in the absence ol iustus titulus, Cod. 7. 39. This was called longissimi
temporis praescriptio.

§ 1. The mention os the nmaway slave in this rather than in the next
section (‘ ancilla fugitiva sui lurtum facere intellegitur' Dig. 47. 2. 603 cf.
Cod. 6. 1. 1) is perhaps due to the senatus-consult (Dig. 48. 15. 2) which
prohibited alienation os fugitivi, and so might be said in some sense to
have placed them in the category ol res extra commercium.

ξ 2. The relation between the enactment ol the Twelve Tables and the
lex ¹Atinia (which apparently was passed about the middle os the second
century B. c.) seems to have been that the latter, while repeating the
prohibition ol the former, added that the vitium lurti should be purged
as soon as the object returned to the possession ol the owner, Dig. 41.
3.4.6; 50.16.215: seeon§3inl.

The lex Plautia (uc. 59) and the lex Iulia (probably ol Augustus)
were less stringent than the other two statutas. The latter had said
that stolen property should in no case be thus acquired, even by au
innocent holder for value (§ 3) ; the former merely excluded the violent
dispossessor himself, and not his innocent transieree or other person.
They related practically to land only, for this did not come within the
operation of the Twelve Tables and lex Atinia, see on ξ 7 inl.

ξ 8. The vitium iuni was purged, and the thing recovered the capacity
ol being acquired by usucapio, by retuming into the hands ol its owner
(§ 8 inl.; cs. Blc iv. 1. 12) or ol his agent to his knowledge. Hence il
a man steals his own property (e. g. from a usufructuary or bona fide
