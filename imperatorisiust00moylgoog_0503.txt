488 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV.

determined by illustrations; the necessity os lntent to constitute the
offense is dwelt upon; and finally there is an examination ol the
question, what interest will suffice to enable a person to bring the
penal action.

Robbery (Title a) implies Thelt; the injured person consequently
may proceed by either actio furti or bonorum vi raptorum, though the ¹
latter, being praetorian, was, so larasit was penal, barred by prescription
in an annus utilis. The distinction between the two offences is that
Robbery is always accompanicd by violence; there is also adifference
in the nature ol the remedy, by which, should the offence be treated
as rapina, both penalty and compensation are simultaneously recovered,
whereas the actio surti ia penal only, compensation being obtained by
condictio furtiva. Astringent enactmentoi Valentinianis here noticed,
which was designed to check violent seizure ol property, moveable or
immoveable, under the pretence that the seizor believed it to be his
own; a plea which excluded the presumption oi dolus malus, and
consequently exempted him lrorn the penalties ol both Thest and
Robbery. lt is also observed that to enable one to sue on the latter
one's interest in the property may be even more slender than is
required to support an actio turri.

The third Title treats oi the lex Aquilia, arr early statute which
practically contains the whole ol the law of lnjury to property, damnum
iniuria datum. The peculiarity ol this Delict is that mere negligence
is sufficient to render one liable to its penalties: ‘non minus quarn ex
dolo ex culpa quisque hac lege tenetur! What amounts to negligence
in this connection is clearly shown bya series of illustrations. The
lex Aquilia contained three chapters, the second oi which was obsolete
under Justinian. The first dealt with the killing ol slaves and certain
domesticated animab, and imposed a penalty os the highest value
such slave or animal had borne at any time within the year imme·
diately preceding. The third related to almost every other kind of
damage to property: its penalty was such property's highest value
within the last thirty days before the wrong was done. Certain exterr-
sions oi the statute hythe ‘interpretatio’ ol the older jurists, and
by the action ol the praetor, to cases not strictly within its letter are
‘noticed, and the wide meaning of ‘damnum’ to be gathered from its
terms is illustrated by examples.

The fourth Delict (Iniuria, Title 4) is aimed at the honour, good
name, and reputation ola free person: it comprises such acts as
assault and battery, libel, slander, and in lact all treatment olor de-
meanour towards a man by which his character is likely to be injured.
