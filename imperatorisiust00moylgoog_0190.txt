INTRODUCTION TO BOOK ll.

Wrrrr the second Book of the Institutas we enter upon the discus·
sion ol the ius quod ad res pertinet. Instead ol giving a plain state-
ment of the contents of this branch of the legal system, Justinian
follows Gaius in presenting us with a number ol very perplexing cross
divisione ol res, which, however, only partially correspond with those
of the earlier writer, and from which we are lelt to gether by induc·
tion the meaning in which they both use the term when they make
it their basis ol classification. In three os these divisione there is no
divergence between the two writers. Res are, lirstly‚ either in patri-
monio nostro or extra patrimonium nostrum (G. ii. 1,lnst. ii. 1. pr.) ;
secondly, they are either corporales or incorporales (G. ii. 12, Inst.
ii. a. pr.); thirdly (though this classilication is rather matter ol inlerence
than ol direct statement), they are either res singulae or universitates
(G. ii. 97, inscii. 9. 6).

The main point wherein Justinian differs from Gaius is his surther
treatment os the res in patrimonio and extra patrimonium. This dis-
tinction Gaius hardly seems to consider of much importance, sor, aller .
stating it, he proceeds: ‘Summa itaque rerum divisio in duos articulos
deducitur, narn aliae sunt divini iuriS, aliae humani3' res divini iuris, as
he goes on to remark, comprising res sacrae, religiosaeand sanctae;
res humani iuris being either publicae or privatae. Justinian, however,
makes it the basis os a lurther subdivision; he arranges the res which
are extra patrimonium in subordinate classes-res communes, res
universitatis, res publicae, and res nullius-the last corresponding
with Gaius’ res divini iuris. Res in patrimonio, on the other hand,
either belong, or can belong, to private individuols (res singulorum);
they seem to be identical with the res privatae ol GaluS, and (the
subject ol the treatise being Private Law) are alone important lor the
purpose in hand. For the ascertainment ol the meaning of the ius
(privatum) quod adres pertinet, the classilications ol res as com-
munes. sacrae, religiosae, publicae, and universitatis may be regarded
as eliminated

books os Gaius and Justinian, we shall find that, so far as the
