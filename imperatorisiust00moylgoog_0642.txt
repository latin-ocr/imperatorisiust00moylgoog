EARLIER HIS Τ ORY OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 627

litigation was tolerably scanty, we may believe that the praetor decided
most suits in person, and perhaps it may be doubted whether he might '
constitutionally refer them to a single iudex before the enactment of
the lex Pinaria. Thelerr Silia made such reference obligatory in a
large class of actions, and an impulse must also have been given to
the practice by the introduction ol iudicis arbitrive postulatio. But
after the lex Aebutia, the distinction between ius and iudicium is
strongly emphasised‚ the latter acquiring more prominence as the
former became less formal. The main object of the proceedings in
iure, as of the pleadlngs in an English action, was to determine the
issues to be tried; their actual trial took place in iudicio. The other
, and more characteristic feature of the new system is the commence-
ment of the action, alter summons and appearance, by a written
document (fonnula concepta verba) addressed by the praetor to the

. iudex who was to try the action, and containing his authority, anda

brief statement of the issues along with the principle upon which he
was to decide them. The praetor stated in his edict the circumstances
under which he would grant an action, e. g. ‘if Aulus assaults Titius,
or if Titius refuses to repay a loan given him by Seius, riedr'cr‘um dabo ;'
and the skeleton of the lonnula was taken from the edict, or from
some special department of it known as the album, and filled out with
flesh and muscle from the allegatione of the parties. It was no part
of the praetor's duty to construet the formula. It was incumbent on
the plaintiff to see that it contained every word and letter which was
essential to his case; it was the defendant's business to see that any
defence which he had, and which by technical rules of pleading was
required to be referred to in the formula, should there be alluded to
accordingly. In a word, the skillul ‘ building up' of a perfect formula
was a task of much nicety, in which a litigant frequently required
considerable technical assistance. When the parties had finally

¹ agreed upon its structure, it was ‘settled’ by the praetor, and the

business in iure was over. Thus, the formula might, and usually did,
contain a number of clauses, some of thern due to and containing, as
it were, the case ol the plaintili ; others due to and to a certain extent
containing the delence of the defendant.

At the head of the formula stood the appointment ol the iudex3
