Possessrou. 325

Possession through lhe other, though this intention‘will be implied
where that other is his own slave acquiring ex peculiari causa, a
guardian, curator, or the egent ola juristic person.

(3) There must bea certain legal relation between principal and
agent. Possession can be acquired through slaves by the dominus
(provided he possesses the slave), the bona fide possessor, and the
usufructuary ; through filiifamilias by the pater (lor persons in manu
or mancipio see Gaius ii. 90); through guardiam or curatore by the
ward, and through lree agents by any principal who has previously
given them a commission, or who has subsequently ratified their acts
(Dig. 41· a. r. ²03 ib. 9. 34. a). Where the agent already has
possession ol the object prior to his commission, the mere subsequent
exercise os will turns his possession into detenti0n; the possession
vests immediately in the principal. This, which is the converse ol'
traditio brevi manu, is called constitutum possessorium.

Possession already acquired is retained by the continuing presence
ol its two elements; but the law does not require lor its retention
so much ‘energy’ (so to spealr) on either side as forits original
acquisition: see Poste, Gaius pp. 646-7. The question how pos-
session is retained is practically equivalent to that how it is lost ; and
it is lost by the cessation ol either corpus or animus domini: ‘quem-
admodum nulla possessio adquiri nisi animo et corpore potest, ita
nulla amittitur nisi in qua utrumque (i. e. aut utrumque aut alter·
utrurn, Sav. Possession §30) in contrarium actum est’ Dig. 41. 2. 8.
Corpus ceases so soon as the possessor loses his abiliry ol dealing
with the thing himself, and ol preventing others lrorn dealing with it;
this may occur by its destruction, by his altogether lorgetting where
it is, or losing it lrom beyond his resch (except in the case ol a run-
away slave, who is possessed till some one else possesses him, or unless
he bona fide believes himself lree, Dig. 41. a. 13. pr.); by its being
stolen, or being taken in possession under a magisterial decree; by
the possessor’s being taken captive, or by the thing itsell ceasing
to be in commercio. In order to lose Possession animo solely,
more is required than a mere cessation ol the previous mental atti-
tude3 there must be a new determination ol the will, an animus in
contrarium actus, a deliberatedesire to transfer or abandon possession.
Consequently, persons ol wealr or unsound mind and pupils cannot
lose Possession animo solo. ln many cases of course Possession is
lost animo et corpore simul; viz. in abandonment, conveyance, manu·
mission ol slaves, and violent ejectmeut from land on which the

rejected person leurs to reenter.
