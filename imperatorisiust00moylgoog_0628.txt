EARLIER HIS T 0le OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 613

geologist is enabled in some measure to reconstruct the natural history
01 past ages, so in vthe language 01 {the Romans, as well as in 'their
law, we find unmistakable testimony that, among the men from
whom their race descended and before the state yet existed even in
embryo, the world, which we conceive as ruled by law, was ruled by
10100, and by personal force alone each man's position was determined.
Might, if not right, is at least her mother ; there being no state
machinery 101 the protection of lile and property, man has either to
suffer his own 011000000001 to keep with the strong arm that which
he has won by his labour or his blood: and theressenee 01· early ideas
lies in the absence 01 any basis 101 right and law other than the
individual consciousness‚ and the consequent necessity 01 seli-asser·
tion: ‘in sich selbst trtgt der Einzelne den Grund seine's Rechts,
durch sich selbst muss er es schtttzen¹.’

Space does not allow us to cite more than a lew 01 the most
striking facts 01 law and language in support 01 this statement.
Thus, the origin and true ground 01 dominium, or lawlul control over
objects 01 enjoyment‚ is placed by the Romans in the idea, -not 01
mere occupatiori or peaceable discovery, but 01 ‘taking' or sorcible
seizure: ‘maxime sua esse credebant,’ says Gaius (iv. ro), ‘quae ex
hostibus cepisseut;' and ¹perhaps the earliest term'bykyrhiclg they
denoted property (mancipium) at once arrests the attentiori, combin-
ing, as it does, with the idea 01 ‘ takiug' another term, manus, which,
as we shall see, is 00 less valuable evidence 01 primitive ideas-3 pro·
perty is that which is taken by strength 01 arm ². Precisely the same
thought reappears 10 the early 10110 01 conveyance ; the property was
deerned to pass not so much in virtue 01 the will 01 the parties, 0101
delivery by the 000 to the other, as by the ‘taking' 01 the object by
the latter (mancipatio); original is symbolised in derivative acqui·

to Mr. McLennari's work on ‘Primitive Marriage,' to show ‘that a
large part 01 mankind still simulate in their marriage ceremonies the
carrying 011 the bride by violence, and thus preserve the memory 01
the reign 01 10100 which, at all events as between tribe and tn'be, pre-
ceded everywhere the reign 01 law;' that, this was usual among the
early Romans might have bcen conjectured 11001 the legend 01 the
