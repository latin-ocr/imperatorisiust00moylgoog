diligentius sibi cautum sit. In omnibus autem obligationibus l
adsumi possunt, id est slvere sive verbis sive litteris sive
consensu contractae fuerint. ac ne illud quidem interest,
utrum civilis an naturalis sit obligatio, cui adiciatur fideiussor,

(1) The obligation of sponsors and fidepromissors did not descend to
their heirs, Gaius iii. 120. (2) By a lex Publilia oi uncertain date a
sponsor who paid the debt could, unless repaid by the principal within
six months, recover twice the amount by actio depensi, Gaius iv. 22.
(3) The lex Furia de sponsu, circ. tte 95 (which, however, extended only
to Italy), limited the liability oi sponsors and fidepromissors to two years
from the date of their contract, and also (4) where there were two or
more of them, divided the liability among all who were living at the time
when the guarantee could be ensorced, so that each could be sued sor only
an aliquot share, Gaius iii. 121. (5) The lex Apuleia, tac 102 (extending
also to the provinces), conlerred a less but similar boon on sponsors and
fidepromissors even outside Italy, by giving to any one orthem who paid
the whole debt an actio pro socio against the rest, by which he could
recover what he had paid in excess of his lair share, Gaius iii. 122.
(6) A statute whose name is illegible in the MS. oi Gaius, iii. 123 (Cicereia,
Rudoril), provided that a creditor, on taking sponsors or iidepromissors,
should first state openly what the debt to be guaranteed was, and also
the number os sureties he was going to take ; if this were not done, they
could by taking action within thirty days procure their release. Gaius
says that this enactment had by usage been extended to fideiussors also,
but it was obsolete under Justinian.

Fideiussio, like sponsio and fidepromissio, is a formos what is called
cumulative intercession, which may be defined as a contract between a
creditor and a third person by which the latter takes upon himself the
debtor's obligation without the debtor being himself released. The torm
in which fideiussio was contracted was ‘idem fide tua esse iubes?
fideiubeo' (Gaius iii. 116), so that the obligation os the principal and
surety was correal: the Greek equivalents are given in ξ 7 inl.

ξ 1. lt was not necessary, as might possibly be inserted from the text,
that the guaranteed obligation should arise ex contractu: it might
originate in delict (though this was perhaps not always so; ‘ex delicto
magis putamus teneri ' Dig. 46. 1. 8. 5), judgment, quasi-contract, or any
other source ; but there must bean obligatio, even though it be naturalis
only, and that obligatio must be another person's: so that it the principal
obligation is or becomes void, the fideiussio is or becomes void likewise,
Dig. 46. t. 29, ib. 47. pn, ib. 56. pr. A curious exception to this had
existed in the older forms ol suretysbip; ior if A promised payment after
bis own death, the promise would be void, Tit. 19. 13 supr, but a sponsor or
fidepromissor to it would be liable, though it bad been a question whether
