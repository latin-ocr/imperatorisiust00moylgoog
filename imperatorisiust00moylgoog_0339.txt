324 EXCURSUS III.

person has merely Detention, without the animus; he then determines
to hold sor himself exclusively ; the Detention is converted into Pos-
session (lor the analogous case ol detention passing into dominium
see Title r. 44 suph). Where A has detention oi an object which B
possesses (e. g. it heis B'slesseel, and it is then agreed that Α shall
possess instead of detain, A becomes possessor r'psosaclo. This is
called traditio brevi manu ; but the sole will oi a person who detains
by pennission or on behali oi another cannot, by itself‚ give him
Possession: see (3) p. 326 inl.

The animus domini implies volition; hence from laclr of this power
the following classes cannot acquire Possession: (ι) thistic persons,
Dig. 4¹· a.1.aa; (a) persons oi unsound or weak intellect, ib. r. 33
(3) pupilli of tender age, unless they have their guardians' auctoritasy'
(4) persons in potestas, or manus, cannot acquire more than Detention ;
lor, being incapable os holding property, they are incapable of animus
domini, except in relation to peculium castrense or quasi castrense3
‘qui in aliena potestate sunt, rem peculiarem tenere possunt, habere et
possidere non possunt, quia possessio non tantum corporis sed et .
iuris est' Dig. 41. a. 49. 1. Again, certain things are excluded from
possession on this ground, viz. res extra commercium ; and the
animus dominiis inconceivable in relation to an object which cannot
itsets be conceived as a sirigle individual thing. Hence the question
arises, how sar is it possible to acquire Possession oi a single part· ol
awhole? Where the single part is to be possessed alone, this is
possible (ι) where the part is in point ol lact a whole itsels: e. g. a
plot of land ol definite extent, which the previous possessor happens
to have treated as part os a larger whole: and (a) where the division
ol the whole into parts is merely intellectum, provided the ideal part
to be possessed is precisely conceived as a definite fraction oi that
whole. But where the part is to be possessed in and through the
whole, the rule is, that though the whole is possessed, the parts
individually are not. For applicatione ol this principle, which is ol
great importance in the usucapio ol buildings, see Poste, Gaius
vr· ⁶4r·8·

We can also acquire Possession through other persons as well as
ι through ourselves. For this the following conditions must be
satisfied:

(ι) The other person (whom for convenience sake we will call the
agent) must have Detention, and also intend to acquire Possession ior
the principal.

(a) The principabor would-be possessor, must intend to acquire
