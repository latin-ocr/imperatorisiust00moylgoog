cognito adversus furem transivit, omnimodo liberari eum
qui rem commodatam accepit, quemcumque causae exitum
dominus adversus furem habuerit: eadem definitione opti-
nente, sive in partem sive in solidum solvendo sit is qui rem
commodatam accepit. Sed is, apud quem res deposita est, 17
custodiam non praestat, ¹sed tantum in eo obnoxius est, si
quid ipse dolo malo fecerit: qua de causa si res ei s‘ubrepta
suerit, quia restituendae eius nomine depositi non tenetur nec
ob id eius interest rem salvam esse, furti agere non potest,
sed furti actio domino competit. In summa sciendum est 18 ,
quaesitum esse, an impubes rem alienam amovendo surtum
faciat. et placet, quia furtum ex affectu consistit, ita demum
obligari eo crimine impuberem, si proximus pubertati sit et
ob id intellegat se delinquere. Furti actio sive dupli sive 19
quadrupli tantum ad poenae persecutionem pertinet: nam
ipsius rei persecutionem extrinsecus habet dominus, quam aut
vindicando aut condicendo potest auferre. sed vindicatio

alius quilibet: condictio autem adversus ipsum iurem here·
demve eius, licet non possideat, competit.

was liable to actio depositi, and could not sue the thies himself, ‘non enim
debet ex dolo suo furti quaerere actionem’ Dig. 47. 2. 14. 3 and 4. He
was also-liable is he had undertaken the custodia, note on Bk. iii. 14 3

tm. The option allowed to the owner ol stolen property betweena
real and a personal action is noted as an anomaly in Tit. 6. 4 inf. aster
Gaius iv. 4 Furtum in no case transferred ownership, so that, as the
owner of the goods stolen remained their owner, the only action logically
open to him was a vindicatio. li the goods had been destroyed, or ir,
being money, it had been spent or mixed with money belonging to the

this and some analogous cases, Bk. ii. 1. 26 and note supr.) a condictio
