ol the strict Roman idea of the term status ; and his rejection of this
view is no reason lor also rejecting that which we have adopted as
the true one. To Hugo's theory, that the real subject ol the ‘ius
quod ad personas pertinet ' is ‘capacity of right,' or the three charac-
ters which correspond to the three forms of capitis deminutio (which
coincides in the main with our own exposition) Savigny is more
favourable, buthe finds himself unable to accept lt because lt does
not account sor the facts, and therefore lachs the very essence ola
tenable explanation: his main objections being that tutela has no
relation to ‘capacity of right' (Rechtslahiglreit) hut only to ‘capacity
for legal disposition' (Handlungsfahiglreit), and the omission of the
important distinction between cives and peregrini, upon which some·
thing has been already said. Il, says savigny, we look more closely
into the actual contents of the first book of the Institutes, we find
that it corresponds very nearly to what he calls family law. lt treats,
in point of fact, of marriage, patria potestas, slavery, patronatus,
guardianship (and, in Gaius, of manus and mancipium). On the other
hand, the division into cives, Latini, and peregrini, important as it ia in
relation to capacity oi right, is not to be found, because it belongs, in
its real nature, to public lav. The most serious objection, in savignys
opinion, which can be urged against his own view, is the omission (in
Gaius) of klnship, hut this he does not consider fatal. Itis remarlr·
able that he did not see how shnder was the coincidence between family
law, as he conceived it, and the ‘ius quod ad personas pertinet' ol
Gaius and Justiniau. The former is in some ways of larger extent
than the latter3 thus it comprises the whole of the relations between
husband and wife, and parent and child, though these belong to the
latter only so far 33 they relate to patria potestas, and also the rules
in respectos patronatus and colonatus, which find no place in the
‘ius quod ad personas pertinet ' whatsoever. In some points, on the
other hand, its content is less. The classifioation ol ‘persons' in
Gaius and Justinian is based upon two great divisions, one ol which
is iuris gentium-all men are either free or slaves-while the other-
all free men are either ingenui or libertini-is iuris civilis, the first of
these, prominent as it is in Gaius and Justinlan, has nothing to do
with family law, because the relation between master and slave is
one which belongs properly to the ‘law of things,' and which, ashes
been pointed out, is touched upon in the first book only by reason of
the capacity of the slave, as distinct from other ‘res' ol becominga
‘persona' hy manumission.

Perhaps one reason why there has been so much dispute as to
