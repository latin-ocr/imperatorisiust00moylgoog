reverse the sentence of a judge, exactly as the republican tribuni plebis
had been entitled to veto the aet of other magistrates. Out of this grew
the practice ol referring legal points in the first instance to the em-
peror by petition‚ to be considered by him in private, and not, as had
been usual with the praetor, in the public forum. These matters be
sometimes decided once for all by a decretum ; but far oftener he replied
by rescriptum, which was a provisional decision of the legal point at
issue, leaving the facts alleged by the petitioner to be inquired into, and
a final settlement made, by another magistrate or an ordinary iudex. lt
also became usual for magistrates, and especially the provincial prae·
sides, to refer difficult cases of law, when in doubt, to the emperor for
advice, and the replies to such consultations were also called rescripta.
Rescripta were technically of two kinds ε epistolae (e. g. Bk. iii. 20. 4 inf),
independent replies to questions referred to the imperial judgment,
which was usually the form employed in answen'ng a magistrate ; and
subscriptiones, brief opinions on cases submitted by petition‚ and written
at the foot of the petition itsell, this being the common form in answering
private persons.

The precise authority of these decreta and rescripta has been much
disputed Savigny (Syst. i. pp. 125-141) contende that their sole binding
force was for the particular case for which they were issued : they might
be cited as authorities for other similar cases, but the judge was under
no strict obligation to apply them in the way in which he was bound to
apply and follow leges proper. lf this is true, then lex in Ulpian's words
(⁴ quodcunque ergo imperatorvel per epistolam constituit, vel cognoscens
decrevit, vel edicto praecepit legem esse constat ') must have a very dif-
ferent sense from that which it usually bears, and the words in the text
(¹ plane ex his [constitutionibus] quaedam sunt personales, nec ad ex·
emplum trahuntur') are still more against Savign'y; for upon his view all
decreta and rescriptaare personales constitutiones, and yet it is quite clear
from the paragraph immediately succeeding (‘nam quod alicui ob merita
indulsit,' etc, in this section) that Ulpian did not conceive them as such.
Even stronger arguments against him are to be found in our knowledge
that the Emperor Macrinus (218n. D.) meditated the repeal of all his
predecessors' rescripta, on the ground that it was intolerable that the
capricious judgments of such tyrants as Commodus and Caracalla should
’ be regarded as law; and that Arcadius and Honorius, in nn. 398,
forbade‚ in future, the application of rescripta, and doubtless of decreta
as well, to cases other than those which they were immediately designed
to determine; the enactment was made even more stringent by Theo·
dosius and Valentinian. This rule was reversed by Justinian‚ who
bears strong evidence against Savigny: ‘sciant hanc esse legem non
