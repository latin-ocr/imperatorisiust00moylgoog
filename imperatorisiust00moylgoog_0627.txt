EXCURSUS X.

ΟΝ THE EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL
PROCEDURE.

A iavourite subject ol speculation- with the political philosophema
ol the syth and 18th centuries was the social condition ot' man in
the remote ages anterior to his anion with his lellows in the organiza-
tion called the state, and the process by which this latter first came
into existence, with all its paraphernalia oi legislatores, judicial insti-

Though the latter ol these theories is no less pure speculation than
the former, it cannot be denied that it is largely supported hy the
