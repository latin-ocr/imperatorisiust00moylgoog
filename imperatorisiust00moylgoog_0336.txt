POSSESSION.

Posssssrow must be conceived as distinct from ownership or do-
minium. In most cases, of course, the two are conjoined: the owner
hes possession of his property. Often, however, they are separated:
the landlord owns the soil which his tenant possesses: his solicitor
has possession of the title-deeds to his estates: the finder of property
possesses it, though another is its owner: and numberless other cases
will at once occur in which the owner and the possessor of a thing
are different persons. But (it may be argued) though this is 30, yet
the relation of a person to a thing which he possesses is immaterial
for purposes of law: the law recognises no rights less than that of
ownership or its fragments. Because I happen to have found a bank
note, and then lose it again, I cannotrecover it from the second
finder: possession in itself is not a legal right at all. lithis were the
case, law·books would be spared one of their most difficult chapters;
but, asa matter of laetali legal systems treat possession, under certain
circumstances, as a right, distinct from and independent of ownership,
and guarantee it protection. It remains to see what, under Roman
law, those circumstances are.

had only Detention, as distinct from possession proper (e. g. the slave,
filiusfamilias, agent, horrower, lessee, and depositary) reference may
be made to Mr. Poste's Gaius, pp. 641-645. The idea of Detention
is limited to certain classes of objects. Nothing can be ‘detained'
