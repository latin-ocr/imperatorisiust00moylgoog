The latest 3ηά most relined forrn ol pledge is hypotheca, in which
there was no conveyauce of either ownership or possession ; it was
effected by a bare iormless agreement between the debtor and creditor,
that certain specific property oi the former should be liable in tut
ior his debt to¹ the latter, who should be entitled to sell in deiault os
payment within a prescribed time: ‘contrahitur hypotheca per pactum
conventum, cum quis paciscatur, ut res eius propter aliquam obliga·
tionem sint hypothecae nomine obligatae: nec adrem pertinet,
quibus ht verbis' Dig. ac. r. 4. Such an agreement, in itsets, was
inoperative to create rights either real or personal: it waS, however,
ensorced hythe praetor, who treated the right ol sale as a ius in re
aliena, ot which the creditor could not be deprived by any subsequent
act oi the debtor, and which he could suceesstutly assert (by remedies
os his own introduction) against any other person whatsoever‚ whether
the creditor, his successor, alienee, or trustee in bankruptcy. The
steps by which this praetorian innovation reached its soll development
are these. lt was first introduced in the Joint interest of landlord
and tenant sanner, in order to enable the latter to pledge his tarming
stochas security sor his rent, a purpose sor which pignus was uot
conveniently applicable: subsequently it earne to be recognised as a
universal mode ol pledge, ol use between debtors and creditors oi
every ltind, though the rights of the latter, in cases other than that ol
landlord and tenant, were protected by remedies differing slightly in
form and name srom those then employed: sor these, and the relation
between them, reference should be made to Blr. iv. 6. 7, ib. 15. 3 ini,
3ηά the notes on both passages.

Hypotheca possessed great advantages over the earlier sorms ol
pledge, of which fiducia was quite obsolete in the time of Justinian
The pledgor was never deprived of the use 3ηά possession oi his
property, and yet the creditor was absolutely secured. The class of
pledgable objects was largely augmented: money could now be lent
on the security ol things not yet in existence, e. g. soture crops and
expectations (‘et quae nondum sunt, sutura tamen sunt, hypothecae
dari possunt, ut fructus pendentes, partus ancillae, setus peconrm'
Dig. 20. 1. 15), or ol mere incorporeal rights, real 3ηά personal
(Dig. ib. 9. ¹3 ib. rr. a; Dig. 13. 7. 18. pn). Moreover it became
possible to create a general mortgage, which was done by statute in
