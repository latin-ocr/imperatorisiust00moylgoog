oi the whole populus, either peaceably assembled in the comitia at Rome,
or engaged in a campaign in the field : for the evidence hereby afforded
that intestate was older than testamentary succession see Maine,
Ancient Law pp. 199, aon Both of them were entirely oral Τὴε will
made per aes et libram was perhaps due in origin to the plebeiam, who
had no locus standi in the comitia calata, though it must have been
largely used by the patricians, owing to the length οἱ the intervals at

, which wills could be made in the comitia, ‘quae bis in anno testamentis
iaciendis destinata erant'Gaius ii. 101. When writing came into general
use, so that the proceedings need no longer be entirely oral, it underwent
important changes, which are noticed by Gaius, ii. 103-108, and alluded
to here by Justinian (partim in usu esse desiit), in particular acquin'ng
the property of secrecy. The will in procinctu, common a few years
before the conquest of Numantia, Velleius Paterc. 2. 5, was obsolete in
the time oi Cicero, de nat deor. 2. 3.

§a This praetorian will, as it is usually called, was really no will at all :
for a will is a disposition oi the civil law, bestowing the hereditas, and
the person taking under it is heres lt grew out of the irksomeness oi the
formalities required in the will per aes et libram, and os the grave injustice
which must frequently have resulted from the avoidance oi wills through
trivial desects or' form, which eventually induced the praetors to uphold
incomplete mancipatory testaments. Regarding form as oi value only so
sar as it secured evidence, all that they required was that the wn'tten
tabulae oi the will should be attested by the seals os seven competent
witnesses: <justiniana remark that sealing had not been necessary by
the civil law seems contradicted by Cicero (in Verr. 2. r, 45), who says
that the edict required ‘tabulas testamenti obsignatas non minus multis
signis quam e lege oportet '). How far, and in what sense, such dis-
positions were upheld is deserving oi carelul notice, sor nothing affords
amore instructive or characteristic illustration os the mode in which the
praetorian law modified and supplemented the old ius civile. By the
latter, such an instrument as a mere written document, no matter by how
many witnesses attested, had absolutely no validity whatever for the
purpose intended Nor had the praetor authority to enact that it should
avail to pass the hereditas, or that the person named in it as heir should
be heir: ‘quos autem praetor vocat ad hereditatem, hi heredes ipso quidem
iure non fiunt: nam praetor heredes lacere non potest’ Gaius iii. 32,
