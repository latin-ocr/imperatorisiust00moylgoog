ROMAN LITERAL CONTRACT AND IIS HISTORl'. 479

’ a iuris gentium contract was not ‘novated' by entry in the codex.
Gaius tells us (iii. 131) that the entry of a genuine money ioan left the
trahsaction a mutuum or real contract, though known by the specific
name of nomen arcarium. The explanation of this seeming anomaly
is that the remedy on mutuum alone of all the real aad consensual
contracts was always condictio: and as consequently novation ofa
mutuum by uanscriptio cordd give the creditor uo advantage which he
did not possess already, its entry in the ledger did not alter the ‘causa'
of the obligation, but served only as evidence, Gaius loc. cit

Expensilatio, as has just been remarlred was a formal civil law
contract, confined to Roman citizens, though the Sabinians had held
that for transcriptio a re in personam at least might be used also by
peregrini. We leam, however, from Gaius that the latter had a form
of literal contract of Greek origin peculiar to themselves, vir. the chi·
rographa and syngraphae, species of bonds of which the former were
signed by the debtor only, while the latter were executed in duplicate,
and signed by both parties. lt seems clear, from the passage referred
to (iii. 134), that, unless made merely ss evidence of a stipulation,
these had binding force for peregrini in themselves, though they would
not have bound citizens: or, as Savigny says (verm. Schriften i. p.
246), it was law in the provinces, as contrasted with Rome, that any
formless document attesting an agreement was actionable.

Asconius, the early commentator on Cicero, observes (in Verr. a. 1.
23) thatin his time the codex, and with it expensilatio‚ had gone out
of use except among banlrcrs (argentarii), who, as might have been
expected, continued longer to lreep their boolrs in the old Roman
fashion‚ though Justinian says iu Bk. iii. ar, that in his own day such
entries, even supposing them to have still been made, had ceased to

create obligations. Whether it be true or notas Asconius (continued
by Eusebius) says himself, that he wrote about the middle of the first
century of our era, the commentary on the Vcrrine orations is of so dlf-
ferent acharacter from the rest that Savigny and Niebuhr may be right

in ascribing it toa rldactear of the fourth century, in which case the
fact that Gaius describes literal contract as apparently in full operation
need create no difficulty. Perhaps, indeed, as was first suggested by
Schtler, the disappearance of nomina transcripticia isto be ascribed to
the introduction of constitutum, which, instead of novating the pre·
existing obligation, added to it a fresh one upon which the creditor, if
successful, would recover an even heavier peual sum than he would by
condictio certi (p. 415 supa), and which was superior to them in its
simplicity and iormlessness.
